# Task 2.4: FA Acquisition History Analysis

**Sprint:** Sprint 1 (Post-FASA Enhancement)
**Phase:** Phase 2 Extension
**Estimated Duration:** 6 hours
**Priority:** MEDIUM (enhances bid intelligence)

______________________________________________________________________

## Objective

Build `mart_fa_acquisition_history` to analyze historical free agent signings and train regression model to predict winning bids based on player performance tier, position scarcity, and time of season.

______________________________________________________________________

## Context

**Problem:** Current bid recommendations use simple heuristics ($1 per 10 projected points for RB), which don't reflect actual league bidding behavior.

**Solution:** Mine `fact_league_transactions` for FA signings and train model to predict winning bids.

**Example insights:**
- High-value RBs (>8 PPG) typically go for $10-15
- WR market more efficient: bids track projections closely
- Early-season FAAD bids 30% higher than in-season
- Position scarcity drives premiums (e.g., only 3 quality RBs available → bids spike)

______________________________________________________________________

## Dependencies

- ✅ `fact_league_transactions` exists (Task 1.2)
- ✅ Historical transaction data loaded

______________________________________________________________________

## Files to Create

### 1. `dbt/ff_analytics/models/marts/mart_fa_acquisition_history.sql`

**Purpose:** Analytical mart of all FA acquisitions with context

**Grain:** `transaction_id_unique` (one row per FA acquisition)

**SQL Spec:**

```sql
{{
  config(
    materialized='table'
  )
}}

/*
FA Acquisition History - analyze winning bids for predictive modeling.

Grain: transaction_id_unique (one row per FA signing)
Purpose: Train bid prediction model for FASA
*/

## Implementation Steps

1. Create `mart_fa_acquisition_history.sql`
2. Create corresponding `_mart_fa_acquisition_history.yml` tests
3. Run: `make dbt-run MODELS=mart_fa_acquisition_history`
