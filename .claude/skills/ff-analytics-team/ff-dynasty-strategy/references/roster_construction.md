# Roster Construction Strategies for Dynasty Fantasy Football

## Win-Now vs. Rebuild Philosophy

### Win-Now Strategy

**Core Principle:** Balance immediate success with long-term planning without overvaluing youth. "Production wins titles, not potential."

**Key Tactics:**
1. Prioritize proven producers over unproven rookies/prospects
2. Target players with track record of consistent production
3. Mix in younger players with upside to maintain long-term viability
4. **Critical:** Hold your draft picks—easiest and cheapest way to add youth and rejuvenate aging roster

**Timeline:** Aim to compete immediately rather than building for distant future window.

### Rebuild Strategy

**Core Principle:** "A well-executed rebuild can transform a struggling roster into a future powerhouse."

**Optimal Timing:** Decide to rebuild early—weeks 4-6 provide good temperature check. Earlier decision = better trade opportunities.

**Key Tactics:**
1. **Draft picks are lifeblood:** Accumulate multiple picks across classes
2. **Focus on 2-3 foundational pieces:** Especially QB core or elite WRs under 26
3. **Avoid RBs during rebuild:** Shortest shelf life means they'll age out before you're ready to contend (2-3 years)
4. **Build through WRs:** Longer careers and more stable value trajectory

**Modern Approach:** "The best way to build a dynasty roster is through wide receivers, with the goal not to win now but to win a few years from now and continue doing so."

## Competitive Window Analysis

**Definition:** Your team's window to compete for championships, typically 2-3 years depending on roster construction.

**Window Dynamics:**

**Typical Window:** Most managers think in terms of maximum 3-year competitive window.

**Building Windows:**
- Takes 1-2 seasons to establish direction from ground-up rebuild
- Drafting RBs early may mean missing their peak if roster isn't ready to contend

**Maximizing Windows:**
- When ready to contend with quality roster, acquire young RBs via trade/draft to align with competitive window
- "Making a considerable push to 'win now' will disrupt the longevity of your roster, but it will maximize the shorter window of contention."

**Strategic Implications:** Understanding when your window is open and making moves to maximize that opportunity is essential. Don't waste competitive years; equally, don't sacrifice future windows for marginal present gains.

## Positional Allocation Strategy

### Optimal Roster Size

**Standard Dynasty:** 25-30 total roster spots, with 27 commonly recommended

**Popular Configurations:**
- 10-team: 25 roster spots
- 14-team: 26 roster spots

### Starting Lineup Formats

**Recommended Format 1:**
- 1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 4 FLEX
- No kicker or defense

**Recommended Format 2 (Superflex):**
- 1 QB, 2 RB, 3 WR, 2 FLEX, 1 Superflex

**Rationale:** "Deeper starting lineups are mandatory in dynasty leagues as they reward managers who build better rosters."

### Position-Specific Strategies

**Quarterbacks:**
- Prioritize securing higher-level QB early (limited streaming options)
- In Superflex: QB = most valuable position
- Keep drafting QBs every year even if you have multiple

**Running Backs:**
- "Get in early and exit before decline begins"
- Teams with every-down back at reasonable price have large competitive advantage
- Top RBs have ultimate trade value in dynasty
- **Key timing:** Sell after year 4, before decline begins (see aging_curves.md)

**Wide Receivers:**
- Be patient with rookie WRs, look for improvement signs in year 2-3
- "Dynasty's blue-chip stocks"—hold value longer, age more gracefully
- Best position to build roster foundation

**Tight Ends:**
- Sophomore TEs show greatest year-over-year growth (98.5% increase in PPR)
- Maintain production through year 7, don't decline significantly until age 30

### Roster Depth Guidelines

**Bye Week Coverage** (reducing issues below 10% probability):
- 1 starter position → 2 roster spots
- 2 starter positions → 4 roster spots
- 3 starter positions → 6 roster spots
- 4 starter positions → 7 roster spots

## Draft Strategy Philosophies

### Zero RB Strategy

**Definition:** Defer RB selection until later rounds, focusing on WR/TE early.

**Dynasty Application:**
- Build through WRs and TEs with longer careers
- Add RBs via trade when competitive window opens
- Exploit RB volatility through late-round fliers and waiver wire

**Risk:** May struggle early if RB depth doesn't materialize

### Robust RB Approach

**Definition:** Prioritize RBs early to secure every-down backs.

**Dynasty Application:**
- Competitive advantage if you secure elite RBs at reasonable cost
- Must time exits correctly before age-related decline
- Trade aging RBs for future picks/young WRs to maintain cycle

**Risk:** RB shelf life means constant replenishment needed

### Hero/Anchor RB Strategy

**Definition:** Secure one elite RB, then pivot to other positions.

**Dynasty Application:**
- Balanced approach: elite production at RB without overdrafting the position
- Pair with strong WR core for flexibility

## Roster Construction Framework

**Step 1: Determine Timeline**
- Assess current roster age, draft capital, competitive position
- Decide: Win-now, retool, or rebuild?

**Step 2: Execute Mode-Specific Tactics**
- **Win-now:** Proven producers + draft picks for youth influx
- **Rebuild:** Accumulate picks + foundational WRs + avoid RBs

**Step 3: Positional Allocation**
- Superflex: Prioritize QB depth
- All formats: Build WR depth as portfolio foundation
- Time RB acquisitions to competitive window
- Be patient with TE breakouts

**Step 4: Continuous Evaluation**
- Reassess competitive window every 4-6 weeks
- Adjust tactics as roster ages or improves
- Balance present opportunity vs. future flexibility
