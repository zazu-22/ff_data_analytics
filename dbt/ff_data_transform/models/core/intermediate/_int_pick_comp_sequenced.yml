    description: |
      Compensatory picks with chronological sequencing - Assigns pick numbers (P13+).

      Grain: One row per compensatory pick
      Source: int_pick_comp_registry with sequencing logic

      Converts comp pick registry into dimensional format with proper pick_id numbering.
      Comp picks are sequenced chronologically by FAAD transaction order per league rules.

      Per League Constitution Section XI.N:
      "All draft pick compensation picks are awarded immediately after a FAAD contract
      is signed and in the order of the FAAD"

      Sequencing:
      - Comp picks come AFTER base picks (P13+) in each round
      - First RFA signing that awards a comp → P13 in that round
      - Second RFA signing that awards a comp → P14 in that round
      - Sequence determined by faad_award_sequence (immutable)
