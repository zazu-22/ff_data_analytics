-- Test: Alert if IDP projections come from too few sources (single point of failure)
-- Fails if any IDP position has source_count < 2 for majority of players
--
-- CONTEXT: As of 2025-10-29, FantasySharks is our ONLY IDP source (see docs/findings/2025-10-29_idp_source_investigation.md)
-- This test will WARN (not fail) until we add a second IDP source
--
-- RISK: If FantasySharks goes down or changes format, we lose ALL IDP data
