# Player Aging Curves by Position

## Running Backs

**Career Arc:**
- **Rookie season:** 88% of baseline average
- **Year 7:** First season production dips below career baseline
- **Year 8:** Distribution of outcomes spreads dramatically

**Key Insight:** "Shortest shelf-life among fantasy positions with significant decline after rookie contract."

**Dynasty Strategy:** "Wise to move off older backs in dynasty before the decline, while their value is highest (typically after year four)."

**Critical Exit Point:** Sell RBs after Year 4, before Year 7 decline begins.

**Why RBs Age Faster:**
- High-contact position with cumulative wear
- Carry volume decreases with age/injury history
- Teams draft replacements on rookie contracts
- Production cliff often comes suddenly rather than gradually

## Wide Receivers

**Career Arc:**
- **Rookie season:** 74% of baseline average
- **Year 2-3:** Significant improvement (sophomore surge)
- **Year 5:** Peak production year
- **Late 20s:** Maintain production into late 20s
- **Decline:** More gradual than RBs, typically age 30+

**Key Insight:** "Hold value longer and age more gracefully than RBs."

**Dynasty Strategy:** Be patient with rookie WRs, look for improvement signs in years 2-3. Blue-chip WRs are dynasty's best foundation.

**Longevity Factors:**
- Less contact than RBs
- Route-running and hands don't decline as quickly
- Can transition to possession roles as speed declines
- Elite WRs maintain relevance into early-to-mid 30s

## Tight Ends

**Career Arc:**
- **Rookie season:** 33% of baseline average (slowest position to develop)
- **Sophomore season:** 94% of baseline (98.5% PPR increase from rookie year)
- **Year 2-7:** Maintain average through year 7
- **Age 30:** Don't decline significantly until age 30

**Key Insight:** "Second-year tight ends show the greatest pattern of year-over-year growth across any skill position."

**Dynasty Strategy:** Don't give up on rookie TEs; expect major year 2 jump. Elite TEs are extremely scarce—hold proven producers.

**Development Timeline:**
- Rookie year often unproductive (learning curve, blocking duties)
- Sophomore breakout is the norm for successful TEs
- Long careers for elite TEs due to unique skill set
- Scarcity creates premium value for top-tier TEs

## Quarterbacks

**Career Arc:**
- **Age 25+:** Efficiency steadily rises starting age 25
- **Ages 28-33:** Peak performance window
- **Mid-to-late 30s:** Many QBs produce strong EPA into mid-to-late 30s

**Key Insight:** Most stable position for aging; many maintain performance well into 30s.

**Dynasty Strategy:** Can safely roster older QBs for win-now pushes. In Superflex, elite QBs are incredibly valuable at any age.

**Longevity Factors:**
- Mental aspects (reads, decision-making) improve with experience
- Modern NFL rules protect QBs from contact
- Positional scarcity in Superflex leagues
- Elite QBs can produce top-5 seasons past age 35

## Alternative Framework: Mortality Tables (Adam Harstad)

**Core Thesis:** Players don't gradually decline; they either maintain performance or "fall off a cliff."

**Evidence:** Study of 100 retired elite RBs/WRs found exactly 50% declined in final fantasy-relevant season—no different from random chance.

**Implication:** "Death rates (75%+ production drops) rise consistently across ages, while non-bust performers maintain relatively stable output until retirement."

**Practical Application:** Rather than projecting "50% of typical Frank Gore," better to think "50/50 shot at getting 100% of typical Frank Gore."

**Reframe:** Player valuation should focus on **survival probability** rather than gradual erosion, making aging players:
- **Safer** if they survive (full production maintained)
- **Riskier** if they don't (sudden cliff, not gentle slope)

## Position-Specific Exit Strategies

### Running Backs
**Optimal Exit:** After Year 4
- Peak trade value (proven production, no visible decline yet)
- Avoid Year 7+ decline phase
- Exception: Elite bellcows with low career mileage

### Wide Receivers
**Optimal Exit:** Age 30-31 (or when target share declines)
- Monitor: Route participation, target share trends
- Earlier exit for speed-dependent WRs
- Possession receivers can extend careers

### Tight Ends
**Optimal Exit:** Age 30 (unless elite producer)
- Elite TEs (Kelce-tier) maintain value longer
- Monitor: Target share, red zone usage
- Scarcity may justify holding elite TEs past typical exit

### Quarterbacks
**Optimal Exit:** Age 35+ (depending on format)
- In Superflex: Hold elite QBs as long as productive
- 1QB formats: More flexible, can stream younger options
- Monitor: Mobility decline, surrounding talent changes

## Applying Aging Curves to Trade Decisions

**Buying Players:**
- **Young upside:** WRs age 23-25, QBs age 25-27, RBs age 22-24
- **Peak production:** WRs age 26-28, QBs age 28-32, TEs age 26-29, RBs age 23-26
- **Win-now assets:** Any elite producer aligned with your window

**Selling Players:**
- **Before decline:** RBs after Year 4, WRs approaching age 30, TEs approaching age 30
- **Peak value:** Players coming off career year who exceed xTD (touchdown regression candidates)
- **Mortality risk:** Any player entering high "cliff risk" age ranges

**Timeline Alignment:**
- **Contending:** Target peak-age players; pay premium for proven production
- **Rebuilding:** Avoid RBs entirely; focus on WRs age 25 and under; collect picks
- **Retooling:** Mix of young WRs + one elite QB/TE to anchor rebuild

## Age-Adjusted Valuation Framework

**Step 1:** Calculate baseline value (VoR, market consensus)

**Step 2:** Apply age adjustment:
- RBs Year 5+: Discount 20-30% due to cliff risk
- WRs 30+: Discount 15-25% depending on style (speed vs. possession)
- TEs 30+: Discount 10-20% unless elite (Kelce-tier)
- QBs 35+: Discount 10-15% in 1QB; minimal discount in Superflex

**Step 3:** Factor in mortality risk:
- High-mileage backs (300+ career touches): Additional 10-15% discount
- Injury-prone players entering decline age: Additional 10-20% discount

**Step 4:** Compare to market value:
- Market undervaluing age decline? Sell
- Market overvaluing age? Buy
