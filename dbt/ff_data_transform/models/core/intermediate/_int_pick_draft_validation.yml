      Draft Pick Validation - Validates completeness of base picks.

      Grain: One row per (season, round) combination
      Source: int_pick_base (generated) vs int_pick_draft_actual (actual transactions)

      Ensures each historical round has exactly 12 base picks to prevent mislabeling
      of compensatory picks due to missing draft data.

      Current State (v2 Phase 3):
      - Generates all base picks via int_pick_base (12 teams × 5 rounds × years)
      - No actual draft transaction data yet (rookie_draft_selection)
      - Validates generated base picks are complete

      Future State (when actual draft data available):
      - Will validate actual draft transactions have 12 base picks per round
      - Incomplete rounds will trigger fallback to generated picks
