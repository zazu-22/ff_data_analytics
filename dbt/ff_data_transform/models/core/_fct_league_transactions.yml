    description: |
      League transaction history fact table - immutable event log.

      Records all league transactions (trades, signings, cuts, drafts, etc.) from
      Commissioner Google Sheet TRANSACTIONS tab with raw event fidelity.

      **Grain**: One row per transaction event per asset
      **Source**: Commissioner Sheet → parse_transactions() → stg_sheets__transactions
      **History**: 2012-2025 (~4,474 transactions)
      **Architecture**: Transaction fact table (Kimball pattern)

      **Contract Semantics**:
      - Extensions: Contract=extension only, Split=full remaining schedule
      - This creates intentional length mismatches (see validation_notes)
      - Deferred: dim_player_contract_history for clean contract state (Phase 3)

      **Data Quality**:
      - 100% player mapping coverage (via dim_name_alias seed)
      - ~0.9% length mismatches (expected for Extensions)
      - ~1.4% sum mismatches (mostly ±$1 rounding)
      - See: docs/analysis/TRANSACTIONS_contract_validation_analysis.md

      - name: has_contract_sum_mismatch
        description: |
          Data quality flag: sum(split) != total.
