Fantasy projections mart - weekly/season player projections with fantasy scoring applied.

Grain: One row per player per season per week per horizon per asof_date
Source: mart_real_world_projections (with scoring rules applied from dim_scoring_rule)

Part of 2Ã—2 model:
- Real-world base: mart_real_world_projections (physical stats)
- Fantasy scoring: This mart (applies dim_scoring_rule dynamically)

League scoring: Half-PPR (no IDP in projections)
