/*
Contract snapshot mart - historical point-in-time contract obligations (commissioner sheet snapshots).

Grain: One row per player per franchise per snapshot date per obligation year
Source: stg_sheets__contracts_active (direct from commissioner's CONTRACTS_ACTIVE sheet)

This mart provides a point-in-time historical view of contract obligations as recorded
in the commissioner's CONTRACTS_ACTIVE sheet at various snapshot dates. This enables:
- Time-series analysis of how obligations changed over time
- Validation of transaction-derived contracts (mart_contract_snapshot_current)
- Historical cap space reconstruction
- Trend analysis of contract structures

Key Differences from mart_contract_snapshot_current:
- Uses direct commissioner sheet snapshots (not derived from transaction log)
- Includes snapshot_date as grain component (enables time-series)
- Shows obligations as commissioner recorded them at each point in time
- May include manual corrections not yet in transaction log

Use Cases:
- Historical cap space: What were my obligations as of Aug 1, 2024?
- Validation: Does transaction-derived view match latest snapshot?
- Trend analysis: How has Player X's value evolved over time?
- Commissioner audit: Track changes between snapshot dates

Grain Example Rows:
player_id=12345, franchise_id=F001, snapshot_date=2024-08-01, obligation_year=2025 → Snapshot 1
player_id=12345, franchise_id=F001, snapshot_date=2024-09-15, obligation_year=2025 → Snapshot 2
player_id=12345, franchise_id=F001, snapshot_date=2024-09-15, obligation_year=2026 → Snapshot 2
