# Multi-Source Snapshot Governance (Implementation Workspace)

This directory is the working hub for planning and tracking implementation of unified snapshot governance across providers (NFLverse, Commissioner Sheets, Sleeper, FFAnalytics projections, KTC).

Goals:

- Establish consistent snapshot metadata and selection across sources
- Stabilize dbt staging with parameterized snapshot selection (baseline + latest)
- Provide validation and monitoring of coverage/deltas before dbt
- Prepare for cloud-ready storage and Prefect orchestration
