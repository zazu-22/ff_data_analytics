      Dynasty market intelligence platform for FASA bidding decisions.

      Transforms tactical FAAB into comprehensive dynasty strategy, by integrating:
      1. Aging curve adjustments (position-specific peak windows, 3yr discounted value)
      2. Market efficiency scoring (model vs market gaps, buy/sell signals)
      3. Sustainability analysis (TDOE regression detection, sticky vs fluky metrics)
      4. League context & VoR (true replacement level vs rostered players)
      5. Enhanced bid recommendations (market-adjusted, contender/rebuilder strategies)

      **Grain:** player_id, asof_date

      **Refresh:** Daily (after Sleeper FA pool refresh)

      **Key Business Logic:**
      - Enhanced value score: 25% dynasty value + 20% aging + 20% market + 15% sustainability + 10% VoR + 10% recent
      - Dynasty 3yr value uses position-specific discount rates (RB:17.5%, WR:10%, QB:6.5%, TE:12.5%)
      - Market signals: STRONG_BUY (gap >25%), BUY (10-25%), HOLD (-10 to 10%), SELL (-10 to -25%), STRONG_SELL (<-25%)
      - TDOE regression: |TDOE| >= 3.0 flags 86-93% reversion probability
      - True VoR: vs median rostered RB2/WR3/TE1, not just FA pool
      - IDP coverage: defensive snap share + playmaking scores for DL/DE/DT/LB/DB/S/CB free agents

      **Research Foundation:** 25,000+ words, 50+ citations (docs/analytics_references/fasa_targets_research.md)

      **Legacy Compatibility:** Original value_score and bid_confidence preserved for comparison
