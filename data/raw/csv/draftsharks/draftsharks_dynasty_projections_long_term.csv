1,BAL,Lamar Jackson,QB,N/A,7,28.7,307.00,1088.00,1776.00,3116.00,Jackson posted an MVP-caliber performance in 2024, resulting in a career-high 488 fantasy points. He’s under contract through the 2028 season,57.40
2,WAS,Jayden Daniels,QB,N/A,12,24.8,301.00,1045.00,1700.00,3174.00,Daniels proved pro-ready, throwing for 3,568 yards, 25 TDs, and 9 INTs on a 69% completion rate. His 891 rushing yards ranked second among QBs in 2024. Washington added useful pieces this offseason, including WR Deebo Samuel and LT Laremy Tunsil.
,51.20
3,BUF,Josh Allen,QB,N/A,7,29.3,299.00,1029.00,1684.00,3265.00,Allen wrapped up 2024 with 3,731 yards, 28 TDs, and 6 INTs in 16 games. He remained excellent on the ground with 531 yards and 12 TDs. Only 29 ahead of next season, Allen’s elite run should continue, especially with his rushing upside.,51.10
4,CIN,Joe Burrow,QB,N/A,10,28.8,41.00,1009.00,1630.00,3083.00,Burrow performed as a high-end QB1 in 2024. He was also one of the offseason winners, as Cincy retained WRs Ja’Marr Chase AND Tee Higgins on long-term deals. Burrow should have multiple years of top-8 production remaining despite his lost 2025 season.,29.10
5,PHI,Jalen Hurts,QB,N/A,9,27.1,302.00,977.00,1564.00,2673.00,The Eagles signed Hurts to a five-year extension in April 2023. In 2024, his passing production took a step back after a career-best 2023. Still, he hit 10+ rushing TDs for the fourth straight year. Rushing should continue boosting Hurts' fantasy value for at least the next couple of seasons,31.20
6,LAC,Justin Herbert,QB,N/A,12,27.5,271.00,888.00,1451.00,2818.00,Alongside new HC Jim Harbaugh, WR Ladd McConkey, and LT Joe Alt, Herbert played excellent real-life ball in 2024. However, he finished as a QB1 in only five of 17 games. The team added Keenan Allen short term,plus the Chargers spent a Round 2 pick on Ole Miss WR Tre Harris. Josh Palmer departed in free agency.,26.80
7,GB,Jordan Love,QB,N/A,5,26.8,246.00,859.00,1386.00,2470.00,Following an up-and-down start, Love excelled as Green Bay's QB of the future in 2023. A Week 1 MCL sprain impacted this past year, but he rebounded to throw for 3,389 yards and 25 TDs for a low-volume passing game. This offseason, Green Bay added a potential WR1 in top pick Matthew Golden,20.90
8,KC,Patrick Mahomes,QB,N/A,10,30,248.00,858.00,1402.00,2716.00,Mahomes posted relatively underwhelming production in 2024. A declining Travis Kelce and injured pass catchers (Rashee Rice and Marquise Brown) kept the lid on Mahomes’ fantasy output. Still, the development of Xavier Worthy was a major positive, while Rice and Brown return for 2025. The Chiefs also spent a mid-round pick on versatile WR Jalen Royals.,23.40
9,ARI,Kyler Murray,QB,N/A,8,28.1,247.00,858.00,1380.00,2301.00,Murray was a huge disappointment in 2024, right alongside an underwhelming Marvin Harrison Jr. We’d expect the young WR to improve in 2025, while TE Trey McBride remains a top target at his position. But Murray, entering his seventh pro season, might have already peaked as a pure passer,19.30
10,CHI,Caleb Williams,QB,N/A,5,23.8,258.00,836.00,1387.00,2662.00,Williams showed the ability to make high-end throws as a rookie. But his tendency to hold the ball and take sacks led to a wildly inconsistent campaign. Fortunately, an improved O-line and an upgraded pass-catching corps arrived this offseason. TE Colston Loveland and WR Luther Burden arrived early in the draft, giving new HC Ben Johnson plenty of offensive weapons,22.40
11,CIN,Ja'Marr Chase,WR,N/A,10,25.5,219.00,830.00,1345.00,2486.00,Chase became only the fifth WR ever to win the triple crown in the Super Bowl era, leading the league in receptions, yards and TDs. He outscored Justin Jefferson (the WR2 on the season) by more than four PPR points per game in 2024. It is unlikely that Chase can repeat such a performance in 2025 (or beyond) but he certainly has the talent. ,94.00
12,DEN,Bo Nix,QB,N/A,12,25.6,243.00,830.00,1352.00,2524.00,An older prospect at 24, Nix proved pro-ready alongside HC Sean Payton. Across 17 games, he tallied 3,775-29-12 -- plus 430-4 rushing. This offseason brought the arrival of veteran TE Evan Engram and Round 3 WR Pat Bryant. Courtland Sutton also signed a new deal.,19.80
13,DAL,Dak Prescott,QB,N/A,10,32.1,243.00,826.00,1361.00,2250.00,Dak’s 2024 was ruined by a hamstring injury that required surgery. He’s on track to be back at full strength well ahead of Week 1 of 2025. At 32 (in July) and with declining rushing production, his days as a bankable QB1 are likely near the end. But he could squeak out one more QB1 year with the addition of WR George Pickens.,17.30
14,ATL,Bijan Robinson,RB,N/A,5,23.6,236.00,824.00,1326.00,2229.00,Robinson profiled as the best RB prospect since Saquon Barkley. Thickly built and explosive, the Texas product simply never earned a consistent role under HC Arthur Smith. With Smith out of town, Robinson's production exploded to 1,881 total yards and 15 TDs in 2024. He's on track to remain a clear RB1 for the forseeable future,100.00
15,TB,Baker Mayfield,QB,N/A,9,30.4,246.00,819.00,1334.00,2528.00,Baker's production reached new heights in 2024. Among the highlights: career-best marks in completion rate (71.4%), passing yards (4,500), and passing TDs (41). The addition of Round 1 WR Emeka Egbuka and the rise of WR Jalen McMillan only add to Baker's appeal,19.30
16,DET,Jared Goff,QB,N/A,8,30.9,237.00,811.00,1308.00,2181.00,Leaning on OC Ben Johnson and an all-star cast, Goff set career highs in completion rate (72.4%) and passing TDs (37) in 2024. The durable veteran projects as a spot-start QB1 over the near term. The loss of Johnson to the Bears isn't ideal, though,15.30
17,SF,Brock Purdy,QB,N/A,14,25.7,235.00,806.00,1322.00,2533.00,Purdy nearly finished as a top-10 fantasy QB in 2024 -- despite the early-season loss of Brandon Aiyuk (ACL). Deebo Samuel departed via a winter trade to Washington. Luckily Ricky Pearsall  looks to emerge as a true threat.,18.50
18,NE,Drake Maye,QB,N/A,14,23,237.00,804.00,1364.00,2699.00,Well-built at 6’4, 230, Maye showed he could make any throw on the field as a rookie. Still, he needed an upgraded supporting cast to flourish in fantasy. New England added O-line talent in free agency and in Round 1 (OT Will Campbell). The draft also brought pass-catching RB TreVeyon Henderson in Round 2 and WR Kyle Williams in Round 3,20.70
19,MIN,Justin Jefferson,WR,N/A,6,26.3,201.00,799.00,1296.00,2374.00,Jefferson ended 2024 as the PPR WR2, notchign his fifth straight 1,000+ yard season to start his career. With Sam Darnold’s emergence, Jefferson was able to catch 10 TDs, matching his career high. He went for 100+ catches for the third time in his career. Jefferson should continue to flourish alongside young QB J.J. McCarthy.,87.50
20,JAC,Trevor Lawrence,QB,N/A,8,25.9,234.00,793.00,1304.00,2485.00,A shoulder injury limited Lawrence to only 10 games in 2024. He was unspectacular when healthy, but there's reason for optimism going forward. The Jags hit a home run with Round 1 WR Brian Thomas Jr. – then added another playmaker in Travis Hunter,17.30
21,HOU,C.J. Stroud,QB,N/A,6,23.9,220.00,780.00,1319.00,2547.00,Missed time from Nico Collins and Stefon Diggs didn’t help. But Stroud took a clear step back in 2024, ranking 33rd among 42 qualifiers in fantasy points per dropback. We remain high on the talent here, but it’s hard to buy a major bounce-back given the current supporting cast. Houston added WR Christian Kirk but traded top LT Laremy Tunsil. The draft brought reinforcements in WRs Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel,17.50
22,IND,Daniel Jones,QB,N/A,11,28.3,239.00,779.00,1271.00,2315.00,Jones' 2023 was derailed by a mid-season ACL tear. Back healthy for a make-or-break 2024, Jones again struggled to prove he's a long-term answer. The team granted his release in November, when he joined the Vikings. He starts for the Colts this year,15.10
23,DAL,CeeDee Lamb,WR,N/A,10,26.4,171.00,770.00,1248.00,2306.00,Even with QB Dak Prescott missing most of 2024, Lamb ended the year as the PPR WR5. Lamb had double-digit targets in six of his nine games and was a WR2 or better in those six. The high volume of targets should continue with Lamb under contract through 2028.,81.80
24,LVR,Ashton Jeanty,RB,N/A,8,21.8,186.00,765.00,1261.00,2201.00,Jeanty went from a 1,900 total yard sophomore season to a 2,700 total yard junior season. He boasts elite contact balance, burst, and receiving ability. Jeanty’s landing spot in Vegas should support some massive workloads over the next few seasons.,91.20
25,NYG,Jaxson Dart,QB,N/A,14,22.3,216.00,765.00,1304.00,2632.00,Dart flashed his arm talent as a true freshman at USC, but he was fully unlocked this past year at Ole Miss. He completed 69.3% of his passes for 4,279 yards, 29 TDs, and 6 INTs. With a quick release and improved coverage recognition, Dart showed the potential to stick as an NFL starter. He also adds enough mobility to make a fantasy impact. The Giants offer a shot at starting at some point in 2025, but Dart’s rookie year figures to be a developmental one,17.30
26,ATL,Michael Penix Jr.,QB,N/A,5,25.3,217.00,763.00,1246.00,2345.00,Penix dealt with four season-ending injuries during his time at Indiana (two shoulder injuries and two ACL tears). Healthy at Washington over his final two college seasons, Penix displayed effortless arm strength and excellent decision-making. As a rookie, he displayed a downfield, attacking style in a brief late-season sample. Kirk Cousins’ rapid fall will put Penix under center again in 2025. He came through with a strong Week 1 performance as a passer and should build on that for the rest of the year.,13.60
27,SEA,Sam Darnold,QB,N/A,8,28.3,202.00,763.00,1234.00,2361.00,J.J. McCarthy arrived as the 10th overall pick, but a season-ending injury allowed Darnold to blow away all expectations. His 4,319 yards and 35 TDs each ranked top-five league-wide. A move to Seattle lowers the fantasy ceiling. And a short-term commitment means Darnold’s dynasty value is truly year to year,13.20
28,TEN,Cameron Ward,QB,N/A,10,23.3,195.00,761.00,1291.00,2554.00,Ward’s college journey took him from Incarnate Word to Washington State to Miami. The top pick improved at each stop, throwing for 4,313 yards, 39 TDs, and seven INTs for the Hurricanes in 2024. Ward showed the ability to extend plays and make accurate throws all over the field. He can also scramble at times, adding potential fantasy value. He’ll be a day 1 starter in Tennessee, but expect him to perform as a fantasy QB2 in ‘25. Longer-term, there’s a top-ten ceiling,15.60
29,MIN,J.J. McCarthy,QB,N/A,6,22.7,226.00,757.00,1265.00,2467.00,McCarthy wasn’t asked to carry a Michigan squad led by a strong defense and run game. Still, the two-year starter flashed a power arm and the ability to execute pro-style concepts under HC Jim Harbaugh. McCarthy isn’t short on athletic traits, either. 2024 was a developmental year on IR, but the 22-year-old should have a chance to emerge in fantasy for 2025,15.20
30,DET,Jahmyr Gibbs,RB,N/A,8,23.5,226.00,756.00,1217.00,2029.00,Despite a slow start, Gibbs largely delivered as a rookie RB. He averaged 5.2 YPC and popped in 10 TDs on 182 attempts, adding 52 receptions. His production reached new heights in 2024, and he proved more than capable as a workhorse back following a late-season injury to David Montgomery. Only 23, Gibbs shouldn't slow down any time soon,88.90
31,NYJ,Justin Fields,QB,N/A,9,26.5,231.00,738.00,1181.00,2019.00,A move to Pittsburgh showed that Fields can be a capable starter in the right situation. But his fantasy ceiling rarely surfaced, and a lack of passing consistency found him playing the backup role to Russell Wilson. While he’s set to be the Jets’ Week 1 starter in 2025, there’s no guarantee Fields is under center for 2026,9.20
32,CAR,Bryce Young,QB,N/A,14,24.2,220.00,727.00,1229.00,2373.00,Young's rookie year was nothing short of a disaster: 2,877 yards, 11 TDs, and 11 INTs across 16 games. HC Dave Canales arrived to help Young post a promising 2024 – particularly later in the season. From Week 12 on, the 'Bama product ranked sixth in QB fantasy points. His supporting cast received a boost with the arrival of Round 1 WR Tetairoa McMillan,12.60
33,HOU,Nico Collins,WR,N/A,6,26.5,189.00,715.00,1158.00,2140.00,A hamstring injury knocked Collins out for part of 2024, but he was still the PPR WR8 in points per game. And that was despite a down year for the Texans' passing game. Collins has now shown two years of top production and is under contract through 2027. ,73.70
34,MIA,Tua Tagovailoa,QB,N/A,12,27.5,219.00,704.00,1094.00,1684.00,A hip injury and a concussion cost Tagovailoa more time in 2024. Persistent health concerns and the potential departure of Tyreek Hill after 2025 make Tua an uninspiring dynasty QB,3.20
35,PHI,Saquon Barkley,RB,N/A,9,28.6,246.00,697.00,1052.00,1700.00,Barkley hit as our 2022 Comeback Pick. 2023 turned up an ugly QB situation and poor efficiency on strong volume. Barkley expressed interest in returning to New York but ultimately joined a superior environment in Philly. From there, he enjoyed a historic 2024 with 2,005 yards and 15 total TDs. Another 1-2 seasons of top-end RB1 production are reasonable,75.40
36,LAR,Puka Nacua,WR,N/A,8,24.3,217.00,692.00,1134.00,2121.00,Nacua dealt with knee issues in the preseason and early in 2024. Still, he ended six of his 10 full games as a top-20 PPR WR. He should retain the target lead in the short term, even after the arrival of WR Davante Adams. We'll also see how L.A. approaches the QB spot with Matthew Stafford entering his age 37 season.,72.80
37,NYG,Malik Nabers,WR,N/A,14,22.1,212.00,689.00,1166.00,2275.00,Despite having Daniel Jones, Drew Lock, and Tommy DeVito, Nabers ended 2024 as the PPR WR7 in points per game. This included five weeks as a top-10 scorer at the position. He commands volume and showcases a complex route tree from short screens to deep routes. He's a star in the making if the Giants can find a QB.,76.00
38,IND,Jonathan Taylor,RB,N/A,11,26.7,220.00,682.00,1048.00,1717.00,Ankle issues and a sluggish Colts offense forced a major drop in production in 2022. Injuries and a contract dispute made headlines in 2023, but when healthy, Taylor flashed his high-end talent. Taylor missed three games in 2024 but remained busy on a per game basis (23 touches per). The former Round 2 pick is under contract for two more seasons,73.50
39,LAC,Omarion Hampton,RB,N/A,12,22.5,199.00,680.00,1070.00,1818.00,Hampton has carried the North Carolina offense for two years (including when Drake Maye was the QB). The former four-star recruit tallied two straight years of 1,500+ rushing yards and 15 TDs, and he brings solid receiving potential. A shifty runner who can hit the home run, Hampton showed his athleticism by crushing the Combine with a 4.48 40-yard dash and a 38" vertical. He landed in a dreamy long-term spot with HC Jim Harbaugh and the Chargers. Hampton should work in tandem with Najee Harris this fall – and then handle a clear lead role in ‘26,74.30
40,DET,Amon-Ra St. Brown,WR,N/A,8,25.9,185.00,676.00,1068.00,1821.00,The Lions' offensive explosion favored St. Brown once again as he ended the season the PPR WR5 in points per game. It was boom-or-bust weekly with six WR1 weeks, but also five weeks at WR3 or worse. We don't love the loss of top OC Ben Johnson -- but St. Brown's volume should stick around going forward.,63.00
41,LVR,Geno Smith,QB,N/A,8,34.9,215.00,661.00,1028.00,1631.00,Smith's 2024 turned up a career-high in passing yards, but he wasn’t able to hit his 2022-level of fantasy production. He was traded to Vegas in March, where he projects as a short-term option for new HC Pete Carroll. Smith remains an uninspiring dynasty bet,0.40
42,ATL,Drake London,WR,N/A,5,24.2,167.00,648.00,1062.00,1986.00,London certainly saw a resurgence under OC Zac Robinson, but QB Kirk Cousins' regression still limited the ceiling. After Michael Penix took over, London averaged 13 targets per game, so the future could be very bright. Despite the tribulations, London ended 2024 as the PPR WR10.,63.00
43,IND,Anthony Richardson,QB,N/A,11,23.3,0.00,644.00,1087.00,2040.00,Injuries and inconsistent play remained a theme for Richardson in 2024. We will see if he starts the entire season for the Colts in 2025 or if Daniel Jones also gets some opportunities.,-2.00
44,MIA,De'Von Achane,RB,N/A,12,23.9,209.00,642.00,990.00,1582.00,Achane's rushing efficiency hit a snag in year two. But his receiving work went through the roof: 78 catches, 592 yards, and 6 TDs. Another RB1 season is in play for 2025, although we'll see if Miami looks to work in more of second-year RB Jaylen Wright,66.30
45,SEA,Jalen Milroe,QB,N/A,8,22.8,17.00,630.00,1063.00,1995.00,Milroe boasts one of the best QB rushing profiles since Lamar Jackson. He should be developed as a passer behind Sam Darnold, giving the Seahawks the potential for an electric QB down the line. If they can figure out how to harness Milroe’s passing, he could be gangbusters for fantasy in a few years,-2.80
46,NO,Tyler Shough,QB,N/A,11,25.9,160.00,614.00,1002.00,1864.00,Shough’s early second-round draft capital makes him the likely heir apparent to QB Derek Carr, who retired in May. Turning 26 in September, Shough will be older than almost a third of starting NFL QBs. Still, he has some appeal given HC Kellen Moore’s resume with QBs,-1.30
47,LAC,Ladd McConkey,WR,N/A,12,23.8,144.00,611.00,1011.00,1810.00,McConkey exceeded expectations and ended 2024 as the PPR WR12 overall. He played through knee and toe injuries throughout the season, missing only one game of his rookie season. McConkey had three top-10 WR performances during the season. The Chargers low pass rate limited his ceiling at times, but McConkey appears locked in as Justin Herbert’s top target for the future.     ,55.10
48,JAC,Brian Thomas Jr.,WR,N/A,8,22.9,149.00,604.00,1004.00,1951.00,Thomas Jr. surprised almost everyone by having an incredible rookie season, even when Mac Jones came in at QB. He ended the season as the PPR WR4 with five weeks as a top-10 WR. With a new coach and OC coming in, Thomas should be the de facto top option with hopefully an even better offensive system.,56.90
49,CIN,Tee Higgins,WR,N/A,10,26.7,153.00,602.00,961.00,1711.00,Higgins was the PPR WR4 in points per game last season, even when dealing with hamstring issues throughout the season. He inked a four-year deal in March, tying him to Cincy through the 2028 season. It’s a win for dynasty managers, as Higgins sticks in a nice volume spot alongside QB Joe Burrow.,51.60
50,CAR,Tetairoa McMillan,WR,N/A,14,22.4,160.00,596.00,1010.00,1969.00,At Arizona, McMillan tallied two straight years of 1,300+ yards and 8+ TDs. He brings a clear X WR skill set at 6’5, 212 pounds. He supplies some deep speed but still has the footwork and route tree to freeze defenders. With long arms and a good catch radius, McMillan boasts tremendous fantasy upside. The Carolina landing spot supplies a path to WR1 targets within a couple of seasons. ,57.50
51,PHI,A.J. Brown,WR,N/A,9,28.2,180.00,591.00,947.00,1683.00,Brown missed a few weeks in 2024 due to a hamstring injury and had to deal with an Eagles offense that shifted to the run, but he still ended as the PPR WR13 in points per game. He’s entering his 28-year old season, and his contract runs through 2029.,51.60
52,GB,Josh Jacobs,RB,N/A,5,27.6,199.00,582.00,870.00,1373.00,The Raiders declined Jacobs’ 5th-year option in 2022, then watched him enjoy his most productive year as a pro. He took a step back in 2023 while playing under the franchise tag, but he was utilized heavily under interim HC Antonio Pierce. He inked a 4-year deal with Green Bay, where his efficiency ticked up and a career-high 16 TDs surfaced in the fall. At 27, another 1-2 years of RB1 production is realistic,54.70
53,LVR,Brock Bowers,TE,N/A,8,22.8,175.00,579.00,942.00,1678.00,Bowers lived up to the hype, setting the all-time rookie receptions record with 110, along with the rookie TE receiving yards record with 1,194. Doing all of that on one of the worst offenses in the NFL was tremendously impressive. Bowers projects as a high-end TE1 for the foreseeable future.,51.40
54,KC,Rashee Rice,WR,N/A,10,25.4,153.00,572.00,937.00,1761.00,Rice is recovering from a torn LCL and may be facing a suspension in 2025. But, after those short term setbacks, Rice is set to be the top WR for Patrick Mahomes for the foreseeable future. In his three full games in 2024, Rice finished no worse than PPR WR16.,50.10
55,NYJ,Garrett Wilson,WR,N/A,9,25.2,144.00,570.00,934.00,1754.00,Wilson’s talent is clear; he had a stretch of three top-five PPR WR performances within five weeks last season. With WR Davante Adams off the roster, Wilson's lone concern remains QB stability.,49.10
56,NYJ,Breece Hall,RB,N/A,9,24.3,180.00,565.00,882.00,1409.00,The 36th overall pick, Hall looked to be on his way to an excellent rookie year. Then came an ACL tear in Week 7. Only 22, the Iowa State product returned for Week 1, 2023, proving both durable and effective in a tough situation. A largely ineffective Aaron Rodgers limited Hall this past fall, while the RB also battled through a knee injury. 2025 turns up a contract year as he competes with Braelon Allen for carries,54.20
57,KC,Xavier Worthy,WR,N/A,10,22.3,151.00,560.00,925.00,1755.00,Worthy took a bit to acclimate to the Chiefs’ offense, but ended the season with three straight PPR WR2 or better performances. His speed and ability to take short passes and screens for big plays finally came to fruition. Paired with QB Patrick Mahomes, the future looks bright for Worthy.,48.50
58,LAR,Kyren Williams,RB,N/A,8,25,200.00,557.00,860.00,1475.00,Williams further solidified himself as a top RB in 2024, logging 1,481 scrimmage yards and 16 TDs. L.A. spent a Round 3 pick on Blake Corum, but he was lightly used throughout the season. Williams signed a new deal locking him in with the Rams long-term.,54.80
59,CIN,Chase Brown,RB,N/A,10,25.5,190.00,551.00,803.00,1032.00,Well-built at ~5’9, 209 pounds, Brown produced a monster 328-1,643-10 rushing line at Illinois in 2022. He then blew up the NFL Combine with a 4.43 forty, a 40-inch vertical, and a 127-inch broad jump. After a quiet rookie year, Brown showed he belongs as a big piece of Cincy's backfield.,44.70
60,BAL,Zay Flowers,WR,N/A,7,25,158.00,550.00,888.00,1550.00,The Ravens leaned a bit more into the pass in 2024 and Flowers benefitted. He had five games with nine or more targets and ended the season as the PPR WR23. The Ravens offense should continue to be high octane with Lamar Jackson at the helm. New addition DeAndre Hopkins doesn't impact Flowers' dynasty value.,43.90
61,SEA,Jaxon Smith-Njigba,WR,N/A,8,23.6,169.00,541.00,882.00,1628.00,JSN broke out in his second year as the PPR WR8 in 2024. He had four games as a top 10 scorer at WR and emerged as the favorite of QB Geno Smith. The Seahawks did fire OC Ryan Grubb, however, so JSN will be in his third offense in three years. He'll also break in a new QB in Sam Darnold.,45.00
62,ARI,Marvin Harrison Jr.,WR,N/A,8,23.1,147.00,537.00,896.00,1720.00,A decade ago, Harrison’s 62 catches for 885 yards and eight TDs would have been a solid rookie season. But, with four other rookie pass catchers going over 1,000 yards receiving, Harrison’s rookie season was a disappointment. The Cardinals remained a run first team, and Harrison’s effort on the field appeared inconsistent at best. He is still young, heading into his 23-year-old season, and still could develop into an elite fantasy producer.
,45.80
63,CHI,Rome Odunze,WR,N/A,5,23.3,149.00,534.00,889.00,1652.00,Chicago's offensive struggles limited Odunze’s rookie-year production. He finished as the PPR WR46, but there were flashes of upside. New HC Ben Johnson has already talked about getting Odunze going in 2025. And an upgraded O-line should help keep QB Caleb Williams on track. Avoid selling low on this former Round 1 WR.,44.40
64,ARI,Trey McBride,TE,N/A,8,25.8,165.00,530.00,864.00,1605.00,McBride was the PPR TE3 for the 2024 season, and this was despite not scoring a receiving TD until Week 17. His 147 targets and 111 catches were enough to carry him in PPR leagues, and there should be some positive TD regression coming. McBride’s talent and Kyler Murray’s willingness to lock onto him should keep McBride as a top dynasty TE going forward.,46.40
65,TB,Bucky Irving,RB,N/A,9,23.1,198.00,529.00,846.00,1436.00,Irving performed as one of the most elusive RBs in the 2024 class. From 2022 to 2023, he forced a missed tackle every 2.5 carries – a terrific mark. That elusiveness translated to the pros right away, as he tallied 5.4 yards per carry and 1,513 total yards. He's locked up lead back work for 2025,52.20
66,PHI,DeVonta Smith,WR,N/A,9,26.8,147.00,519.00,841.00,1504.00,In 2024, Smith played second fiddle to A.J. Brown and also dealt with a concussion and hamstring injury. He had three PPR WR1 weeks out of his 13 weeks played and ended as the WR17 in points per game. Smith has a solid floor, but if the Eagles stick as a more run-heavy team, he may retain a capped ceiling.,39.20
67,NE,TreVeyon Henderson,RB,N/A,14,22.9,123.00,518.00,819.00,1351.00,Henderson was highly recruited and is insanely explosive when given space. He also shows elite receiving ability but doesn't regularly break through contact. He ran as expected at the Combine with a 4.43 40-yard dash and tied for second among RBs with a 1.52 10-yard split. Henderson projects as an upside PPR back and should eventually see the lion’s share of the rushing work in New England,45.00
68,BUF,James Cook,RB,N/A,7,26,202.00,517.00,744.00,1096.00,Cook was a fantasy non-factor for most of his rookie season. When given chances, though, he showcased the burst that made him the RB2 in the 2022 draft. That trait truly surfaced in 2023, especially late as Buffalo fired OC Ken Dorsey and elevated QB coach Joe Brady. Then, at 25, Cook erupted for a massive 18 total TDs in 16 games. The TDs will certainly go down as a career-high. But as long as he sticks with Josh Allen long-term, his lead back role will remain highly desirable,42.80
69,SF,Christian McCaffrey,RB,N/A,14,29.3,238.00,513.00,738.00,1181.00,CMC was excellent in 2023, finishing as the clear-cut RB1. Then came a nightmare 2024 that included multiple lower-body injuries (and only 50 total carries). He'll be a rebound candidate in 2025 -- but durability concerns figure to remain for the 29-year-old,45.40
70,PIT,D.K. Metcalf,WR,N/A,5,27.8,153.00,510.00,816.00,1409.00,Metcalf finished as the PPR WR33 in 2024. The speed is still there, but he tallied only three PPR WR1 performances all season. The trade to Pittsburgh (and subsequent extension) ties him to the club long-term. The absence of a long-term QB simply adds a layer of uncertainty.,36.60
71,CHI,D.J. Moore,WR,N/A,5,28.4,147.00,507.00,780.00,1221.00,The Bears' offense was inconsistent all season. Still, Moore did have three PPR WR1 weeks in 2024. He finished as the WR31 in points per game, but that's set to rise under new HC Ben Johnson. Moore remains in his prime at 28.,31.90
72,TB,Emeka Egbuka,WR,N/A,9,22.9,140.00,501.00,884.00,1758.00,Egbuka went back for his senior year to chase a National Championship and caught 70 passes for 896 yards and 10 TDs. He is an ideal NFL slot WR with a quick first step and clean routes to turn slants and drags into big gains. While the Round 1 draft capital was nice, the Bucs don’t supply a clear landing spot for meaningful short-term targets. Mike Evans returns for 2025, Note that Evans is only under contract for one more season.
,43.40
73,NO,Chris Olave,WR,N/A,11,25.2,149.00,501.00,817.00,1448.00,Olave suffered two concussions that cost him most of the 2024 season. Olave remains a good talent and is only entering his age-25 season. We're also encouraged by the hiring of new HC Kellen Moore.,36.30
74,WAS,Terry McLaurin,WR,N/A,12,30,141.00,497.00,768.00,1250.00,A superstar season from QB Jayden Daniels pushed McLaurin into WR1 territory. He had four WR1 weeks, plus another seven WR2 weeks. McLaurin’s 12 TDs on the fantasy season were also a career-high. He enters his age 30 season and the final year of his contract, so there is some unknown in the near future. His holdout could also affect his in-season performance.,31.20
75,JAC,Travis Hunter,WR,N/A,8,22.3,143.00,496.00,845.00,1679.00,Hunter showed elite receiver ability last year, catching 96 passes for 1,258 yards and 15 TDs while also playing full-time on defense. The Heisman winner is a smooth mover with excellent hands and body control. Jacksonville traded up to secure Hunter, who's fully expected to play on both sides of the ball. Most importantly, Hunter will have a sizable role on offense. We’ll keep a close eye on his deployment alongside Brian Thomas Jr. this offseason.,40.50
76,DAL,George Pickens,WR,N/A,10,24.5,151.00,496.00,801.00,1398.00,Pickens’ 2024 season had massive peaks and valleys. He tallied two weeks with a top-five PPR finish and four at WR50 or worse. He was dealt to Dallas in a May trade, a move that supplies a much more pass-friendly offense. Just be aware that Pickens enters a contract season.,34.90
77,TB,Chris Godwin,WR,N/A,9,29.5,133.00,492.00,760.00,1236.00,Godwin suffered a dislocated ankle that cost him most of the 2024 season. Pre-injury, he performed as one of the top WRs league-wide. In March, he signed a three-year deal to remain in Tampa Bay.  He could miss time to start the 2025 season.,30.40
78,MIA,Tyreek Hill,WR,N/A,12,31.5,155.00,484.00,703.00,1125.00,The Dolphins offense stalled in 2024, between QB Tua Tagovailoa’s concussion and lower efficiency than 2023. Hill suffered the most, finishing down to PPR WR30 in points per game. He did have four WR1 performances on the season, but another four where he ended as a WR4 or worse. With Hill entering his age 31 season, questions on his long term viability remain.,27.60
79,DET,Jameson Williams,WR,N/A,8,24.4,148.00,477.00,781.00,1460.00,Williams had four PPR WR1 performances in 2024 and finally appeared to be fully implemented into the offense. He remains a deep threat first, but in time, Williams could become a steadier fantasy WR. His rookie deal keeps him under team control for two more seasons.,34.30
80,SF,Ricky Pearsall,WR,N/A,14,25,149.00,477.00,778.00,1438.00,Pearsall flashed in limited 2024 work but will remain behind Brandon Aiyuk and likely Jauan Jennings for another season. The future looks bright, as Pearsall could fill the WR2 role if Jennings departs in 2026.,33.80
81,MIN,Jordan Addison,WR,N/A,6,23.6,139.00,477.00,789.00,1414.00,Addison was a boom-or-bust WR in 2024. He posted two weeks as a top-five PPR WR but only had two other WR2 or better games all season. The Vikings' high-flying attack aided Addison, who finished as the WR20 in points per game. He’s entering only his age-23 season in 2025.  ,33.30
82,DEN,Courtland Sutton,WR,N/A,12,29.9,152.00,473.00,741.00,1220.00,Sutton took a bit to warm up to rookie QB Bo Nix, but he had three top-10 PPR games in the second half of the season. He ended the season as the WR28 in PPR points per game and is signed through the 2029 season after signing an extension in July.,29.60
83,TB,Mike Evans,WR,N/A,9,32.1,157.00,473.00,695.00,1109.00,Evans did it again, hitting 1,000 yards receiving in 11 straight seasons. He ended the season as the PPR WR11 in points per game. He's under contract through 2025 and should still be effective for at least another year. ,26.80
84,LAR,Matthew Stafford,QB,N/A,8,37.6,210.00,471.00,710.00,1062.00,Stafford is under contract through the 2026 season and looked excellent for stretches of 2024. His back issues create more questions for 2025, however. At 37, though, we know retirement is around the corner.,-16.40
85,MIA,Jaylen Waddle,WR,N/A,12,26.8,150.00,470.00,751.00,1338.00,The Dolphins offense sputtered in 2024 and Waddle’s numbers suffered. He only had one week as a PPR WR1. He ended the season as the WR55 in points per game. This offense should bounce back in 2025, but Waddle may never regain the WR1 upside he showed years ago.,31.20
86,LAR,Davante Adams,WR,N/A,8,32.8,160.00,469.00,647.00,1065.00,Adams' midseason trade to the Jets paired him back with Aaron Rodgers, and it paid off with some big games. He joined another proven veteran for 2025, inking a two-year deal with QB Matt Stafford and the Rams. Adams should deliver WR2 value in the short term.,24.80
87,CLE,Jerry Jeudy,WR,N/A,9,26.4,140.00,456.00,723.00,1233.00,Jeudy popped for a career-best 90-1,229-4 line as a first-year Brown. He’s under contract through the 2027 season but remains without a long-term QB.,27.70
88,IND,Tyler Warren,TE,N/A,11,23.3,133.00,451.00,758.00,1460.00,In 2024, Warren was the Nittany Lions’ leading receiver with 104 catches for 1,233 yards and 8 TDs. He has a massive 6’6, 261-pound frame with the typical Penn State top-tier athleticism. Add in monster in-line blocking, and Warren projects as an impact rookie for the Colts. QB play might cap his short-term ceiling, though. Indy will roll into the season with Anthony Richardson and Daniel Jones.,37.70
89,CHI,Colston Loveland,TE,N/A,5,21.4,86.00,448.00,770.00,1517.00,Loveland had an injury-filled 2024, dealing with a shoulder and another undisclosed injury. With Michigan’s offensive issues, Loveland was still their leading receiver with 56 catches for 582 yards and five TDs. His awareness and quick feet make him dangerous against zone coverage, reminiscent of Travis Kelce. We like Loveland’s landing spot alongside QB Caleb Williams and HC Ben Johnson. Note that the Bears can move on from Cole Kmet’s contract in the ‘26 offseason.,36.90
90,SF,Brandon Aiyuk,WR,N/A,14,27.5,128.00,442.00,716.00,1281.00,Aiyuk’s Week 7 tear of his ACL, MCL, and meniscus could mean a slow start to 2025. 2024 did not treat him well as he was the PPR WR58 in points per game. On the bright side, he's locked into the X WR role in Kyle Shannahan's offense through 2028. San Francisco also traded Deebo Samuel this offseason.,27.20
91,GB,Matthew Golden,WR,N/A,5,22.1,121.00,439.00,744.00,1452.00,Golden was a surprising four-star commit to Houston, where he showcased deep threat talent. Moving to Texas this past season unleashed his potential with 58 catches for 987 yards and 9 TDs. He was also the fastest WR at the NFL Combine with a 4.29 40-yard dash. Green Bay saw enough to select him in Round 1, and they’ve already talked up his speed, hands, and versatility. He should make a Year 1 fantasy impact – especially with Christian Watson rehabbing a torn ACL.,29.80
92,LAC,Quentin Johnston,WR,N/A,12,24,138.00,428.00,700.00,1310.00,Johnston had a much better sophomore season in 2024, flashing the deep catch ability he had in college. With the Chargers likely to stick as a rush first team, Johnston will be a boom or bust player going forward. ,26.80
93,DAL,Brandon Aubrey,K,N/A,10,30.5,146.00,428.00,697.00,1321.00,,21.60
94,DET,Sam LaPorta,TE,N/A,8,24.7,123.00,425.00,696.00,1303.00,After a rocky start to the 2024 season, LaPorta ended the season with five straight PPR TE1 performances. The Lions’ high-octane offense means that LaPorta will always be a threat to score. He is locked in as a top dynasty TE moving forward. ,32.80
95,CAR,Chuba Hubbard,RB,N/A,14,26.3,187.00,424.00,559.00,737.00,Hubbard set career highs with 250 carries, 1,195 yards, and 10 TDs in 2024. Carolina rewarded him with a contract extension in November. He projects as the clear lead back for at least 2025, as Jonathon Brooks rehabs a second ACL tear. We see rookie RB Trevor Etienne as a complementary piece,26.10
96,IND,Michael Pittman Jr.,WR,N/A,11,27.9,136.00,423.00,678.00,1170.00,Pittman played all of the 2024 season with a back injury. So it's no surprise he underwhelmed for fantasy managers (69-808-3 on 111 targets). Persistent QB questions make Pittman a shaky bet to bounce back in '25.,23.70
97,SF,Jauan Jennings,WR,N/A,14,28.2,137.00,420.00,666.00,1155.00,Jennings filled in admirably for Brandon Aiyuk after his knee injury, having more success than Aiyuk did early in the season. Jennings will likely revert back to the slot in 2025, the final year of his contract.,23.30
98,NO,Spencer Rattler,QB,N/A,11,24.9,165.00,418.00,696.00,1314.00,Rattler, a five-star high school recruit, lost his job to Caleb Williams at Oklahoma. Transferring to South Carolina, Rattler never delivered on the massive hype that followed him to Norman. Still, he flashed the arm talent and arm strength that excited evaluators just a few years ago. The NFL draft wasn't kind to Rattler, as he fell to Round 5 in 2024. He made several starts as a rookie but ultimately looked overmatched for a talent-thin Saints offense. Rattler will have to battle to see the field in 2025, even if Derek Carr’s shoulder injury proves serious. New Orleans spent a Round 2 pick on QB Tyler Shough.,-17.20
99,BUF,Khalil Shakir,WR,N/A,7,25.6,126.00,416.00,671.00,1222.00,Shakir was the favorite target for QB Josh Allen in 2024 and saw some high-volume weeks throughout the season. Buffalo rewarded him with a multi-year extension in February. He's now under contract through the 2029 season.,23.60
100,BUF,Keon Coleman,WR,N/A,7,22.3,136.00,413.00,698.00,1388.00,Coleman flashed some talent in 2024, but a wrist injury sidelined him for most of the second half of the year. He's still young and paired with QB Josh Allen for the foreseeable future. Buffalo's addition of WR Josh Palmer isn't ideal, but he doesn't crush Coleman's dynasty value.,27.10
101,IND,Josh Downs,WR,N/A,11,24.1,125.00,412.00,703.00,1279.00,Downs flashed some success in 2024, especially with Joe Flacco at QB. But Anthony Richardson reduced the Colts' passing volume to a point where it was risky to start Downs. Perhaps Richardson will develop as a passer, but there's little to suggest he'll become consistent. Indy seems to feel similarly after adding Daniel Jones in free agency.,24.90
102,SEA,Kenneth Walker III,RB,N/A,8,24.9,166.00,411.00,587.00,749.00,Injuries limited Walker to a career-low 11 games in 2024. He flashed a high ceiling when healthy but ultimately managed just 3.7 YPC. We'll see how he's utilized under new OC Klint Kubiak,25.60
103,WAS,Deebo Samuel,WR,N/A,12,29.7,156.00,409.00,610.00,859.00,It was a disappointing 2024 for Samuel, who couldn’t seem to get much going despite injuries to Brandon Aiyuk and Christian McCaffrey. The veteran WR tallied just 51-670-3 in 14 games. A move to Washington supplies a shot at a larger role -- and a chance to play with one of the NFL's top young QBs. Deebo's unlikely to deliver fantasy value beyond the next couple of years, though.,17.80
104,BAL,Derrick Henry,RB,N/A,7,31.7,226.00,405.00,534.00,869.00,Even at 31, Henry put together a masterful 2024 (325-1,921-16). He's now hit 325 carries in two of the past three seasons, but the former Titan has shown no signs of slowing down. Henry signed a two-year contract extension in May,27.90
105,GB,Jayden Reed,WR,N/A,5,25.3,0.00,404.00,652.00,1139.00,Reed started hot with two top-two PPR performances in the first four weeks of 2024. But as the Packers moved more to the run, Reed fell off. He had five games as a WR5 or worse. He ended as the WR39 in points per game. Reed is still young, but Green Bay's pass rate remains an issue in the near term.,15.00
106,DEN,RJ Harvey,RB,N/A,12,24.6,88.00,402.00,573.00,732.00,Harvey was a surprise second round pick, but two straight years of 1,400 rushing yards and good receiving skills could make him the “Alvin Kamara” of Sean Payton’s offense. He likely won’t immediately be a three-down back, but there is long term upside to get there for a Broncos team that likes to run,20.80
107,CLE,Quinshon Judkins,RB,N/A,9,21.8,172.00,401.00,629.00,1065.00,Judkins has a chance to become an immediate three-down back. He answered questions about his athleticism with a 4.48 40-yard dash at the NFL Combine and tied for second among RBs with a 1.52 10-yard split. We’ll see how he works alongside Round 4 RB Dylan Sampson,30.70
108,HOU,Jayden Higgins,WR,N/A,6,22.8,95.00,400.00,666.00,1237.00,Higgins should start opposite Nico Collins in the Texans offense with Christian Kirk playing the slot. His size (6’4, 212 pounds) gives him Higgins turned heads at the Senior Bowl and NFL Combine, where he ran a 4.47 40-yard dash along with a 39" Vertical and 10'8 Broad Jump. ,21.30
109,GB,Tucker Kraft,TE,N/A,5,24.8,136.00,396.00,639.00,1175.00,With Luke Musgrave battling injuries most of the season, Kraft established himself as a true receiving threat for the Packers. He ended as the TE13 in PPR points per game and had seven TE1 performances. His ceiling may be capped, but Kraft has emerged as a consistent TE presence.,26.90
110,LVR,Jakobi Meyers,WR,N/A,8,28.8,147.00,388.00,588.00,889.00,Meyers was a high-volume option for the Raiders after Davante Adams departed. With a new coach, GM and offense coming in, Meyers' outlook has some short-term uncertanty. The move to get QB Geno Smith at least looks like a huge 2025 upgrade.,16.00
111,SF,George Kittle,TE,N/A,14,31.9,138.00,383.00,581.00,819.00,Kittle was the top PPR TE in 2024 in points per game. At 32 (in October), he should have at least a couple of years left at TE1-level production.,16.50
112,NO,Rashid Shaheed,WR,N/A,11,27,94.00,383.00,597.00,980.00,Shaheed missed most of 2024 after meniscus surgery, but he was flashing as the deep threat for the Saints before that. He is under contract through 2025 and may be able to put up another solid season if he can come back fully healthy.,14.80
113,CHI,Luther Burden III,WR,N/A,5,21.8,75.00,381.00,645.00,1241.00,Burden joins a stacked Bears team with DJ Moore, Rome Odunze, and Colston Loveland. But if there is a HC who can scheme touches for him, it is Ben Johnson. His ability in the screen and short passing game could make him a weapon, though he may struggle to produce consistent fantasy numbers early in his career.,19.00
114,TEN,Calvin Ridley,WR,N/A,10,30.8,131.00,381.00,581.00,933.00,Ridley was one of the few weapons on the Titans in 2024, leading to several big games due to volume. A QB upgrade arrived in the draft via top pick Cam Ward. His playmaking ability should help Ridley’s spike-week potential. Note that Ridley is signed through the 2027 season.
,15.30
115,CLE,Dillon Gabriel,QB,N/A,9,24.7,177.00,377.00,627.00,1185.00,Gabriel was a surprise third-round pick for the Browns, but enters one of the worst QB rooms in the league. Though Kenny Pickett and Joe Flacco will get first crack to start, Gabriel could see starts as a rookie. He is small, but the rushing upside and accuracy are intriguing for QB2 numbers if he gets a chance in the future,-20.60
116,DAL,Javonte Williams,RB,N/A,10,25.4,150.00,374.00,534.00,682.00,Williams entered 2022 with enormous expectations. But only four games in, he suffered an ACL/LCL tear in his right knee. He was rarely unleashed in Year 3 under HC Sean Payton. An inconsistent role remained a theme this past fall. At 25, he landed in a solid spot with Dallas in the early stages of free agency.,20.80
117,DET,Jake Bates,K,N/A,8,26.5,125.00,374.00,626.00,1193.00,,13.90
118,LAC,Tre Harris,WR,N/A,12,23.5,102.00,372.00,615.00,1101.00,Harris joins a unit desperate for talent outside of Ladd McConkey. His size, production and downfield speed makes Harris a great deep threat for QB Justin Herbert. He should be locked into a starting spot with a good QB, but HC Jim Harbaugh will always want a run first offense.,16.90
119,LVR,Dont'e Thornton Jr.,WR,N/A,8,22.8,65.00,368.00,622.00,1191.00,Thornton was a four-star recruit who headed to Oregon based on his speed and athletic ability. He never quite developed in Eugene, but found some success as a deep threat in Tennessee over the last two seasons. A downfield role is a realistic one for Thornton in Vegas.,16.40
120,SEA,Tory Horton,WR,N/A,8,22.8,80.00,367.00,622.00,1174.00,Horton was looking to follow up his 1,136 receiving-yard season from 2023 with a big 2024, but a knee injury cost him significant time. Still, he enters the league with an excellent size/speed combo. And despite lasting until Round 5, he lands with a Seattle team offering little WR depth. Horton has gotten some work with the first team in training camp.,16.70
121,LAC,Keenan Allen,WR,N/A,12,33.3,143.00,366.00,550.00,913.00,Allen had a few peak games with Caleb Williams when things were humming, but he played through even more injuries and is an upcoming free agent. Another year older, Allen’s best NFL days are behind him.,14.10
122,NE,Kyle Williams,WR,N/A,14,22.8,56.00,365.00,608.00,1129.00,Williams is an elite deep threat who was added to one of the worst WR groups in the league. He should find an immediate role, though may be limited to deep shots and big plays. Being paired with Drake Maye is a great landing spot. As only a Round 3 NFL Draft pick, he isn’t guaranteed playing time, but the situation is good enough for him to be on the back end of dynasty rosters.,14.70
123,HOU,Jaylin Noel,WR,N/A,6,23,28.00,365.00,618.00,1183.00,Noel was drafted to join college teammate Jayden Higgins. He played primarily in the slot at Iowa State, but showed some outside ability at the Senior Bowl. Likely to start as the back-up to Christian Kirk, Noel could develop into a starting role by his second year.,14.20
124,NE,Stefon Diggs,WR,N/A,14,31.8,106.00,364.00,529.00,846.00,Traded to the Texans in April of 2024, Diggs tallied one PPR WR1 performance in his eight active weeks. An October ACL tear calls his 2025 effectiveness into question, but Diggs certainly landed in a fine spot for volume. Just note: Despite signing a three-year deal, the Pats can reasonably get out of the deal in 2026.,10.60
125,BAL,Mark Andrews,TE,N/A,7,30,112.00,363.00,574.00,989.00,Andrews bounced back from his early-season woes to be the PPR TE6 overall and TE7 in points per game. He also ended the season with five straight TE1 games. With Lamar Jackson locked in as the QB going forward, Andrews retains a TE1 outlook.,16.00
126,DET,Isaac TeSlaa,WR,N/A,8,23.6,83.00,362.00,635.00,1178.00,The Lions gave up two 2026 third round picks to secure TeSlaa, so his athletic upside and toughness enticed them to take a shot on the massive upside. He could be developed to replace Jameson Williams down the line, but the lack of college production is concerning.,17.30
127,BUF,Dalton Kincaid,TE,N/A,7,25.9,112.00,359.00,567.00,986.00,Kincaid had a disappointing 2024, ending up as the TE21 in points per game. Dealing with injuries and an uneven offensive passing game didn’t help his numbers. On the bright side, he drew 75 targets in only 13 games, so Josh Allen has not given up on the young TE. Buffalo remains without a clear WR1, helping raise Kincaid’s bounce-back appeal in 2025.,15.40
128,MIN,T.J. Hockenson,TE,N/A,6,28.2,116.00,357.00,555.00,935.00,Hockenson returned from his torn ACL and MCL and ended the season as the TE14 in points per game. He had a few spike weeks but looked short of 100% for most of the season. 2025 brings bounce-back potential – if QB J.J. McCarthy proves capable.,14.40
129,NO,Alvin Kamara,RB,N/A,11,30.2,180.00,356.00,466.00,538.00,Despite another strong receiving season, Kamara set a career-low in rushing yards in 2023 (694). He signed a two-year contract extension in October 2024, keeping him under team control through the 2026 season. In '24, he generally outperformed expectations before a late-season groin injury,17.20
130,CLE,Cedric Tillman,WR,N/A,9,25.4,108.00,356.00,571.00,1038.00,Tillman showed that he can be an X WR after Amari Cooper was traded, but a concussion sidelined him after a couple big games. But with uncertainty around the QB and offense moving forward, Tillman may be tough to rely on in '25.,14.20
131,SEA,Cooper Kupp,WR,N/A,8,32.3,106.00,352.00,511.00,817.00,Kupp ended the 2024 season as a WR4 or worse in four of his last five games. He also sustained another injury – this time a high-ankle sprain. Kupp landed on his feet, though, inking a three-year, $45 million deal with Seattle. The fit with QB Sam Darnold is questionable, but Kupp should see fantasy-friendly volume – if he can stay healthy.,8.90
132,BUF,Tyler Bass,K,N/A,7,28.6,103.00,352.00,571.00,1059.00,,7.90
133,KC,Marquise Brown,WR,N/A,10,28.3,112.00,351.00,552.00,916.00,Brown missed most of 2024 with a shoulder injury. He returned late in the season but made a minimal impact. In March, Kansas City re-signed him on a one-year deal worth $6.5 million. Brown could hold WR3 value this fall, but the long-term picture remains blurry.,11.80
134,TEN,Elic Ayomanor,WR,N/A,10,22.3,108.00,349.00,591.00,1174.00,A beacon of talent on an awful football team, Ayomanor sports perhaps the best body control in the class. He is built on highlight catches and physically boxing out defenders to keep position. The overall athleticism is there, but he struggles with concentration drops that will need to be cleaned up. He had a solid NFL Combine running a 4.44 40-yard dash, though he had the slowest 10-yard split among WRs at 1.58. Ayomanor landed in an excellent spot for long-term opportunity.,16.30
135,CLE,David Njoku,TE,N/A,9,29.2,89.00,347.00,536.00,857.00,Njoku battled injuries throughout the season but was no stranger to spike weeks when he played. He ended as the TE4 in PPR points per game. He had a TE1 performance in seven of the 11 games he played. The Browns' offense is concerning, but Njoku will be a value if his current trend continues.,9.40
136,NYG,Cameron Skattebo,RB,N/A,14,23.6,165.00,346.00,534.00,938.00,Skattebo will get plenty of hype as a hard-nosed runner with 1,711 rushing yards in 2024. Arizona State utilized him in the passing game plenty, but he doesn’t present top-notch athleticism. Skattebo did show his explosion at the NFL Combine with a 39.5" vertical. While his Round 4 draft capital isn’t ideal, Skattebo landed in a fine spot for opportunity,23.50
137,BAL,Rashod Bateman,WR,N/A,7,25.8,101.00,346.00,548.00,935.00,This former first-round pick finally flashed for the Ravens as a complement to Zay Flowers. The issue for 2025 is the addition of DeAndre Hopkins, who arrived in free agency on a one-year deal. Note that Bateman is signed through the 2026 season.,11.30
138,JAC,Travis Etienne,RB,N/A,8,26.6,162.00,344.00,415.00,582.00,Etienne missed time with a hamstring in 2024 and was out-played by Tank Bigsby for parts of the season. Only 26, the Clemson product has one year left on his deal but will break in a new coaching staff in 2025,15.20
139,CLE,Harold Fannin Jr.,TE,N/A,9,21.2,104.00,343.00,631.00,1302.00,With David Njoku only having one year left on his deal, Fannin will likely be developed to become the starting TE for the Browns in a year. He broke every college football TE record and has a natural feel for catching the ball. As a long-term investment, he could pay dividends.,23.50
140,PIT,Kaleb Johnson,RB,N/A,5,22.1,67.00,342.00,560.00,860.00,Johnson fits the Steelers as a hard nosed between the tackles runner with great contact balance and power. He should help fill the Najee Harris role and split with Jaylen Warren. The Steelers appear to be taking it slow with Johnson's development,18.60
141,ATL,Darnell Mooney,WR,N/A,5,27.8,126.00,342.00,519.00,821.00,Mooney had an inconsistent 2024 fantasy season but showed he's a reliable number two WR for the Falcons. His contract runs through 2026. With aggressive QB Michael Penix Jr. taking the helm in 2025, Mooney has a chance to flash again.,9.90
142,MIA,Jason Sanders,K,N/A,12,29.8,111.00,342.00,550.00,1015.00,,6.60
143,CAR,Xavier Legette,WR,N/A,14,24.6,92.00,339.00,547.00,955.00,Legette flashed a bit with his size and speed, but he dealt with injuries throughout his rookie 2024 season. With QB Bryce Young showing improvement, there is still plenty of upside for Legette in the X WR role in HC Dave Canales’ offense.
,10.80
144,LVR,Jack Bech,WR,N/A,8,22.8,56.00,338.00,563.00,1045.00,Bech joins a Raiders WR group that was among the worst in the league. His sharp route running and great hands make him an immediate impact slot player, perhaps with Ladd McConkey type of upside. He should be the third receiving option behind Brock Bowers and Jakobi Meyers.,10.80
145,NYG,Russell Wilson,QB,N/A,14,36.8,10.00,338.00,469.00,742.00,Wilson recaptured his early and mid-career magic for part of the 2024 campaign. He fizzled down the stretch, though, finishing as a QB1 in only one of his final eight games. He won’t be a lock to start a full season in 2025, given the presence of Jameis Winston and Round 1 pick Jaxon Dart,-33.70
146,SF,Brian Robinson Jr.,RB,N/A,14,26.5,57.00,337.00,430.00,573.00,Despite missing several games, Robinson set a career high with 8 rushing scores in 2024. His receiving usage predictably declined, though, while 2025 turned up a move to San Francisco. He's now a clear handcuff to Christian McCaffrey.,10.40
147,PHI,Jake Elliott,K,N/A,9,30.7,126.00,337.00,540.00,986.00,,6.40
148,CHI,D'Andre Swift,RB,N/A,5,26.7,153.00,336.00,414.00,567.00,Swift’s usage took an odd turn in 2022. His receiving numbers dipped, while his goal line production was capped by Jamaal Williams. Detroit showed their cards the next offseason, signing David Montgomery early in free agency (3 years, $18 million). Swift, of course, was dealt to Philly following the Lions' addition of Jahmyr Gibbs. His 2023 in Philly proved inconsistent, but he ultimately set career highs in touches and yardage. Chicago provided a fine free agent spot for volume, but a poorly orchestrated offense and a weak O-line limited the fantasy impact. Swift isn't someone we'd be betting on going forward,14.40
149,GB,Romeo Doubs,WR,N/A,5,25.4,111.00,336.00,561.00,984.00,Doubs continued his high snap counts as a starter in 2024, but the Packers moved to a more run-heavy offense. With limited passes to spread around, Doubs is a high-floor, low-ceiling option. His contract runs through 2025.,12.60
150,DEN,Marvin Mims Jr.,WR,N/A,12,23.5,79.00,335.00,568.00,1087.00,Mims finally started to gain traction toward the end of the season. The talented young WR has speed to be a deep threat and a unique RAC weapon. Mims is worth stashing as the Broncos offense continues to develop next year.
,12.40
151,NYG,Tyrone Tracy Jr.,RB,N/A,14,25.8,110.00,334.00,439.00,580.00,Tracy spent five years as a WR -- four at Iowa. In 2022, he transferred to Purdue and soon made strides as a tackle-dodging RB. He dominated the NFL Combine, showing plenty of straight-line speed and explosion for a 5’11, 209-pound back. He delivered instant value as a rookie with 1,123 total yards, despite New York providing a terrible supporting cast. The arrow was pointing straight up – until the Giants used a Round 4 pick on bruising RB Cam Skattebo. The rookie supplies serious workload concerns for Tracy,13.20
152,DEN,Troy Franklin,WR,N/A,12,22.6,112.00,333.00,564.00,1080.00,Franklin flashed here and there, but was buried on the depth chart behind Marvin Mims and fellow rookie Devaughn Vele. The Broncos are developing Franklin slowly, and he still has a connection with QB Bo Nix. He is worth stashing. ,13.90
153,DAL,Jake Ferguson,TE,N/A,10,26.7,131.00,333.00,500.00,822.00,Ferguson dealt with both a knee injury and a concussion during the 2024 season. With QB Dak Prescott knocked out with an injury, it was an inconsistent year for Ferguson, who ended as the PPR TE19 in 2024. He remains a high-floor, low-ceiling option.,9.20
154,JAC,Bhayshul Tuten,RB,N/A,8,23.6,139.00,332.00,515.00,892.00,Tuten carried the Virginia Tech offense for two years after transferring from North Carolina A&T. He has excellent speed and vision and is also a top-notch returner. Though Tuten's short-area quickness leaves a lot to be desired, he flashed receiving upside as a sophomore. He posted elite numbers at the NFL Combine as the fastest RB in the 40-yard dash, running a 4.32. He also had the best Vertical (40.5"). Tuten could earn lead-back status by late 2025,20.70
155,NE,Kayshon Boutte,WR,N/A,14,23.3,88.00,332.00,563.00,1061.00,In terms of snaps, Boutte was the top Patriots’ WR in 2024. Though he didn’t have consistent fantasy numbers, it is a good indicator that he could finally be hitting his potential. Expect the team to continue adding talent, but Boutte may stay involved moving forward.,12.40
156,KC,Harrison Butker,K,N/A,10,30.2,120.00,332.00,535.00,986.00,,4.80
157,TEN,Tony Pollard,RB,N/A,10,28.3,154.00,331.00,484.00,618.00,Pollard set career highs across the board in 2022. He earned the franchise tag in March of '23, then watched the team release veteran Zeke Elliott. Still, coming off a January fibula fracture, Pollard took a major step back in 2023. Pollard rebounded in 2024, outplaying Tyjae Spears and playing through injuries to post his third straight 1,000-yard season. The drawback is that he’ll play 2025 at 28 years old, so he’s likely in the tail-end of his prime.
,16.90
158,KC,Jalen Royals,WR,N/A,10,22.6,39.00,331.00,561.00,1058.00,Royals showed promise as a catch-and-run threat at Utah State. A foot injury limited his 2024 production, but we were impressed by his 2023 breakout in a bad offense. He’s a developmental piece to watch over the next couple of seasons.,9.60
159,ARI,Trey Benson,RB,N/A,8,23.2,183.00,330.00,557.00,937.00,Benson’s college career started ominously with a multi-ligament knee tear at Oregon (2020). Transferring to Florida State in 2022, the 6’0, 216-pounder showcased an ideal blend of power and speed. That carried over to the Combine, where he posted an elite 9.78 Relative Athletic Score. He entered the league with plenty of tread on his tires after tallying 156 and 154 carries over his final two college seasons, but a healthy James Conner limited the rookie’s impact. Arizona signed Conner to an extension in 2024, muddying Benson’s short-term outlook,24.30
160,LVR,Tre Tucker,WR,N/A,8,24.5,121.00,330.00,530.00,964.00,Tucker got some work after the Raiders traded away Davante Adams. His speed and skillset are intriguing, but Tucker will likely fall back down the depth chart when the Raiders add additional WRs.,11.40
161,WAS,Matt Gay,K,N/A,12,31.5,113.00,329.00,527.00,963.00,,3.10
162,NE,Demario Douglas,WR,N/A,14,24.8,87.00,328.00,526.00,957.00,The Patriots offense didn’t impress in 2024, and Douglas rarely saw enough passes to make a fantasy impact. Aligned with QB Drake Maye and a new offense in 2025, Douglas could still retain a slot role in the short term.,9.30
163,LAR,Joshua Karty,K,N/A,8,23.5,114.00,328.00,563.00,1147.00,,8.50

165,PIT,Jaylen Warren,RB,N/A,5,26.8,159.00,327.00,395.00,554.00,Warren tallied 5.3 YPC in 2023, third most among RBs with 100+ attempts. He remained in a rotational role alongside Najee Harris last fall but saw his efficiency and volume decline. Harris departed in free agency, so Warren’s usage could rise alongside rookie Kaleb Johnson in ‘25. The veteran inked a two-year extension in September.,13.40
166,SEA,Zach Charbonnet,RB,N/A,8,24.7,139.00,325.00,463.00,591.00,Charbonnet posted huge numbers at UCLA over his final two seasons (398-2,496-27, 22 games). Size-adjusted, (6’0, 214), he tested as a strong athlete at the Combine. Seattle made him a surprising Round 2 pick, and his usage was predictably limited alongside Kenneth Walker in 2023. A 2024 breakout never truly came, although he showed workhorse potential in games missed by Walker. Seattle will break in a new OC in 2025,15.00
167,LAC,Cameron Dicker,K,N/A,12,25.3,131.00,325.00,550.00,1097.00,,8.00
168,NYG,Wan'Dale Robinson,WR,N/A,14,24.7,121.00,324.00,520.00,946.00,With the Giants down in most games, Robinson saw strong volume from the slot in 2024. Robinson is still young with good shiftiness in his routes, so a QB upgrade in 2025 should serve him well. The TD upside is simply limited.,10.50
169,DEN,Pat Bryant,WR,N/A,12,22.8,68.00,323.00,553.00,1067.00,Bryant was a surprise third-round pick, but HC Sean Payton compared him to former Saints WR Michael Thomas. Bryant isn’t fast, running a 4.61 40, but he is quick off the snap with good hands. He likely slots behind the top four WRs for the Broncos, but is unique in his slant and possession WR ability compared to the rest of the group.,10.60

172,MIN,Jordan Mason,RB,N/A,6,26.3,153.00,317.00,469.00,690.00,Mason delivered fantasy gold before the return of Christian McCaffrey. Mason later landed on IR with an ankle injury, but we've seen no reason for long-term concern. A trade to the Vikings supplies a part-time role in 2025 – with a potential starting gig coming in ‘26,16.40
173,WAS,Jacory Croskey-Merritt,RB,N/A,12,24.4,142.00,316.00,488.00,857.00,A dispute over eligibility limited Croskey-Merritt to only one game in 2024. But he flashed NFL potential in 2023 at New Mexico with 189-1,190-17. The Washington backfield has some long term uncertainty, as Brian Robinson and Austin Ekeler enter contract seasons.,18.80
174,TB,Jalen McMillan,WR,N/A,9,23.8,69.00,316.00,539.00,981.00,McMillan stepped up in the Chris Godwin role late in the 2024 season, posting five straight WR2 or better games. We buy the talent here. But McMillan's target share is simply limited in the short term after Chris Godwin returned on a three-year deal.,8.90

176,BUF,Joshua Palmer,WR,N/A,7,26,105.00,313.00,497.00,892.00,Palmer played behind WRs Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston on the 2024 Chargers. He tallied just 39-584-1 for run-happy OC Greg Roman. Buffalo threw a good chunk at him in free agency (3 years, $29 million with $15M GTD), so a sizable role appears likely in ‘25. Palmer turns just 26 in September.,8.00

He finished as the TE20 in points per game and did not see enough targets to be reliable. He will be a free agent after the 2025 season, so there could be hope for him as a lead TE elsewhere down the line.,5.30

182,DET,David Montgomery,RB,N/A,8,28.3,159.00,306.00,448.00,571.00,Montgomery inked a 3-year deal in March of 2023 with $11 million guaranteed. Playing alongside Jahmyr Gibbs, the former Bear proceeded to set a career-high in TDs (13) across 14 games. He remained an excellent TD producer in 2024 but saw his volume regress. The veteran is under contract through the 2027 season after signing a new extension in October,14.20
183,ATL,Kyle Pitts,TE,N/A,5,24.9,98.00,305.00,490.00,853.00,Another year of disappointment with Pitts. He ended as the TE18 in PPR points per game, only posting three TE1 performances all season. The inconsistency, even with a new offense and QB, was maddening. Perhaps QB Michael Penix provides a boost, but likely, Pitts isn't long for Atlanta. 2025 is a contract year.,5.10

He also jumped 41.5 inches and tallied a 10’9” broad jump – all at 221 pounds. Wild. Guerendo’s tape didn’t match the testing numbers, however. And it’s important to note that he was the 1B option this year behind 2024 late-round pick Jawhar Jordan (132 carries to 181). Despite a long, underwhelming college career, Guerendo’s rare athleticism is an enticing match for Kyle Shanahan's offense. We saw that in a narrow window in 2024, although injuries limited his late-season impact. He'll have a real chance to be CMC's handcuff in 2025,7.50

He averaged a robust 3.66 yards after contact per attempt for his college career – plus 5.9 yards per carry and 35 rushing scores. However, Allen didn’t show much as a pass-catcher. One silver lining: The former four-star prospect is only 21 following a quiet rookie year. ,12.10

While undersized, the Tulane product is a capable pass catcher with excellent burst and agility. He showed that in 2023, filling a change-of-pace role behind Derrick Henry en route to 837 total yards. He looked like a 2024 breakout candidate...until Tennessee signed Tony Pollard, who held lead back duties. Both RBs return for a shaky-looking offense in 2025,13.00

211,MIA,Ollie Gordon II,RB,N/A,12,21.7,77.00,280.00,437.00,735.00,A tale of two years. Gordon had over 2,000 total yards as a sophomore flashing great change of direction and vision. He was dangerous in space and used as a receiver in the flat. In his junior season, Gordon couldn’t seem to find any running room and tried to go for the big play too often. His Combine was mediocre running a 4.61 40-yard dash with pedestrian numbers across the board. Gordon could revert back to being a stud, but also has tons of downside on his recent film.,11.30
212,TB,Rachaad White,RB,N/A,9,26.7,90.00,280.00,337.00,473.00,We were pumped to see White — an athletic back with pass-catching ability — land in Round 3 in 2022. He managed to get on the field early and eventually work in tandem with Leonard Fournette. 2023 turned up workhorse usage, boosted by a thin backfield and a surprisingly effective Baker Mayfield. However, we baked in some dynasty risk last year following the arrival of Bucky Irving, who proved pro-ready. White has one year left on his rookie deal.,5.40
213,GB,Savion Williams,WR,N/A,5,23.8,27.00,277.00,472.00,860.00,Williams was a unique weapon at TCU, lining up at RB, WR, and Wildcat QB. The Packers have a pretty full WR room, but will likely use Williams on special teams and the occasional gadget play.

214,PHI,Tank Bigsby,RB,N/A,9,24,0.00,276.00,414.00,554.00,Bigsby wrapped up a productive career at Auburn with 540-2,903-25 (35 games). He tested as an average athlete at the Combine, however, and his struggles carried over into a mistake-filled first season. Bigsby looked like a different back in 2024, showing the power and burst that made him an attractive prospect. A wrench was thrown into his 2025 plans, as the Jags traded him to Philly over the summer. He’ll settle into a backup/handcuff role. ,4.60

Wicks’ level of play simply didn’t match his rookie season. There is still some upside, but the Packers' run-based offense won’t help the fantasy value here.,4.20
217,WAS,Jaylin Lane,WR,N/A,12,23.3,39.00,273.00,463.00,873.00,Lane is a versatile player with great return ability and speed.

He blossomed into a legit deep threat, setting career highs in yards per catch (19.2), aDOT (13.8), and yards per route run (2.70). Lambert-Smith led Auburn pass catchers in catches and yards and tied for first in TDs. KLS was widely considered a Shrine Bowl winner and further boosted his stock with a 9.11 Relative Athletic Score at the NFL Combine.

225,LAC,Najee Harris,RB,N/A,12,27.5,0.00,265.00,388.00,495.00,Harris was out-played by Jaylen Warren at times in 2023. Still, the 'Bama product managed to play all 17 games and hit 1,200+ total yards for the third straight season. Harris remained Pittsburgh's go-to rusher in 2024, although he lacked much of a fantasy ceiling. He landed in an excellent spot this offseason, as the Chargers supply a strong O-line and run-game commitment.  His worrisome eye injury also dampens any expectations.,2.60

While effective when healthy, Jones' $16 million cap hit proved too much for Green Bay to stomach. Jones battled through injuries to play all 17 games for the Vikings in 2024, while he set a career-high with 1,138 rushing yards. The Vikings supply an excellent situation, but the veteran remains at risk for decline at 30.,7.90

230,NE,Rhamondre Stevenson,RB,N/A,14,27.6,119.00,261.00,409.00,541.00,Following a promising rookie season, Stevenson really broke through in 2022. Most promising was his emergence as a pass catcher. Stevenson regressed in 2023 alongside an offense that failed to take a step forward. He also suffered a late-season high-ankle sprain. The 26-year-old was held back by a poor O-line and fumbles in 2024, although the rise of Drake Maye certainly helps for 2025. We'll see how the RB is valued by a new coaching staff.,8.80

A torn meniscus and an MCL sprain ended his 2022 prematurely, but he rebounded for a healthy 2023. The issue: Corum’s advanced rushing metrics declined sharply, while his raw production got a boost from his elite O-line. His rookie year came and went without much fanfare, as Kyren Williams remained a workhorse. Corum also suffered a broken forearm in January.,6.80

According to The Athletic’s Bruce Feldman, Wright hit a Tyreek Hill-like 23.6 MPH in practice. The three-year Volunteer averaged a ridiculous 7.4 yards per carry in 2023, with 19 of his 136 attempts going for 15+ yards (per PFF). He showed out at the Combine with a 4.38 forty time and a 38-inch vertical. Miami provides an ideal landing spot for creative usage, but 2024 turned up light work behind De'Von Achane,10.70

An injury-filled 2024 resulted in only 33 catches for 532 yards and 5 TDs. Despite never having a 700-yard receiving season, Bond’s athleticism makes him a potential NFL starter. He was expected to run in the 4.2s at the NFL Combine, but only mustered a 4.40. Bond signed with the Browns in mid-August, so the late start could be an issue making a team.,-0.90

He ranked third behind Malik Heath and Jonathan Mingo in receiving in ‘22. Watkins repeated the finish in ‘23, this time behind fellow prospect Tre Harris. Watkins set career highs in yards, YPC, and TDs in 2024. Still, he ranked third on the team in targets with a moderate 16.5% share. Watkins could blossom into a WR3, but we don’t see upside beyond that.,-3.90

251,PIT,Roman Wilson,WR,N/A,5,24.3,43.00,242.00,413.00,751.00,Wilson couldn’t crack a thin WR lineup as a rookie, but a pair of injuries supplied a legitimate excuse. We’ll see if he can emerge as Pittsburgh’s WR2 after the trade of George Pickens. Only 24, Wilson brings some sleeper appeal.,-3.10
252,LAR,Tutu Atwell,WR,N/A,8,25.9,62.00,241.00,383.00,687.00,After a quiet 2024, Atwell surprisingly earned a one-year, $10 million deal in March. The money is fully guaranteed, so he might see career-high volume in '25. Of course, the Rams are set at the top of the depth chart with Puka Nacua and Davante Adams. Keep expectations in check here.,-3.90
253,ATL,Kirk Cousins,QB,N/A,5,37.1,14.00,241.00,300.00,384.00,Cousins lasted 14 games as a year-one Falcon ... and then was benched for Round 1 pick Michael Penix Jr. He could still be traded midseason to a contender and earn back some fantasy value. We'd be surprised if he starts beyond then,-42.40
254,ARI,James Conner,RB,N/A,8,30.3,0.00,239.00,354.00,544.00,Conner missed time with another injury in 2023 -- this time a knee. Yet he remained effective on a bad team with 208 carries, 1,040 yards, and 7 TDs. Despite the addition of rookie Trey Benson, Conner remained the clear starter in 2024. Arizona even signed the veteran to an extension in November, but his injury could mean Conner is closer to the end of his career.,0.90
255,TEN,Chimere Dike,WR,N/A,10,23.8,50.00,238.00,394.00,729.00,Dike spent his first four years of college at Wisconsin in a run first offense. The 4.3 speedster flashed at times, but never was able to take over a game. He ended the season with 42 catches for 783 yards. His 18.64 yards per catch ranked 17th in the country. With Dike’s experience and athleticism, he has a ton of upside with some coaching and development.
,-3.60
256,JAC,Parker Washington,WR,N/A,8,23.5,47.00,236.00,403.00,734.00,Washington came in when injuries forced him up the depth chart and had a productive game with QB Mac Jones. He'll return to compete for slot snaps in '25.,-3.30
257,IND,Adonai Mitchell,WR,N/A,11,22.9,57.00,233.00,403.00,760.00,Mitchell’s athletic upside was on display when injuries hit the Colts WRs. He showed the ability to be a deep threat and also do some damage after the catch. Unfortunately, the pass rate with Anthony Richardson remained low and Mitchell is clearly behind Josh Downs, Michael Pittman, and Alec Pierce. It may be tough sledding to make a fantasy impact anytime soon.,-2.90
258,WAS,Ben Sinnott,TE,N/A,12,23.3,24.00,233.00,398.00,739.00,Zach Ertz re-emerged in 2024, keeping Sinnott on the bench for most of the season. He flashed his athleticism at times but was asked to block more than catch. Ertz will return for another season, but there's plenty of time for Sinnott to develop.,-11.10
259,CHI,Kyle Monangai,RB,N/A,5,23.5,78.00,232.00,369.00,661.00,Monangai has two straight 1,200+ rushing yard seasons for a Rutgers offense that worked through him. Tough runner with a low pad level who can work well through contact. Has also flashed on some outside runs. Solid NFL back-up whose best football may still be in front of him.,6.10
260,CAR,Trevor Etienne,RB,N/A,14,21.2,12.00,231.00,363.00,621.00,Etienne showed pro potential at Florida but played behind a true freshman after transferring to Georgia. Like his brother Travis, Trevor has pass-catching ability that should be utilized in the pros, but he may be more third-down back than starter.,2.70
261,CIN,Mike Gesicki,TE,N/A,10,29.9,72.00,231.00,359.00,549.00,Gesicki signed a one-year deal in 2024 and returned value with 65-665-2. He received an offseason endorsement from QB Joe Burrow and ultimately returned on a three-year deal. With Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins now signed for multiple years, Gesicki will remain a role player.,-13.40
262,MIA,Nick Westbrook-Ikhine,WR,N/A,12,28.5,60.00,227.00,357.00,593.00,NWI impressed as a deep threat, scoring long TDs when the Titans offense got hurt. Of course he fell back off, but he could maintain that role in HC Brian Callahan’s offense.,-6.60
263,TEN,Gunnar Helm,TE,N/A,10,23,33.00,227.00,387.00,719.00,Helm broke out in his final season for Texas, catching seven TDs as a rare downfield H-Back. His soft hands could help make him a fantasy spot-starter within a couple of seasons.,-11.70
264,NO,Kendre Miller,RB,N/A,11,23.3,54.00,226.00,358.00,511.00,Miller exited TCU with only one season as the full-time starter. But it was spectacular: 224 carries, 1,399 yards, and 17 TDs. He didn’t complete athletic testing after undergoing surgery for an MCL tear. Injuries remained an issue in 2023 and 2024, but we remain intrigued by the skill set here.,2.60

266,GB,MarShawn Lloyd,RB,N/A,5,24.7,54.00,225.00,342.00,526.00,Lloyd’s college career began at South Carolina with a 2020 ACL tear. A quiet two-year stretch followed – then a move to USC. In 2023, he handled a 1A role alongside fifth-year senior Austin Jones (116 carries to 85). Lloyd displayed plus vision, acceleration, and open-field elusiveness en route to 7.1 yards per carry. Injuries ruined his 2024, but Lloyd is in the driver's seat to be the No. 2 behind Josh Jacobs in the short term.,2.20
267,HOU,Nick Chubb,RB,N/A,6,29.7,85.00,223.00,307.00,401.00,Chubb struggled to produce leading up to Week 15 of 2024. Then came a broken foot, ending his season. At 29, it’s fair to wonder how much is left in the tank. After signing a one-year deal in June, Chubb will operate as the No. 2 RB behind Joe Mixon.,1.10
268,NYJ,Arian Smith,WR,N/A,9,23.9,53.00,223.00,369.00,684.00,Smith spent most of his career as a one-trick deep threat pony. His deep speed will be an asset in the NFL, similar to Marques Valdes-Scantling. His skillset was expanded a bit on Georgia this past season, leading the team in receiving, but he is far from nuanced enough to be an instant starter in the pros.,-5.60
269,DAL,Jalen Tolbert,WR,N/A,10,26.5,53.00,223.00,342.00,563.00,Tolbert was forced to step up after Brandin Cooks was injured and had some success. Despite that, it is doubtful he becomes a fantasy producer.,-8.20
270,LVR,Michael Mayer,TE,N/A,8,24.2,74.00,222.00,360.00,645.00,Mayer missed part of 2024 with personal issues but came back and was implemented as the in-line TE. With Brock Bowers there and a new coaching staff in place, Mayer is unlikely to be a fantasy contributor for the Raiders. ,-12.00
271,CIN,Tahj Brooks,RB,N/A,10,23.3,45.00,220.00,348.00,624.00,Two straight 1,500-yard rushing seasons with double-digit TDs marks Brooks’ success at Texas Tech. His shifty feet lead to very few hard hits, and Brooks can certainly hit the homerun. Outside of missing one game in 2024 with an arm injury, Brooks has been healthy despite being a bellcow with 576 carries over the past two seasons. Though the downfield passing offense rarely targeted him as a receiver, that may be Brooks’ best role in the NFL. ,3.00
272,NYG,Darius Slayton,WR,N/A,14,28.7,92.00,220.00,346.00,527.00,When Malik Nabers was hurt, Slayton had a few spike games for the Giants due to volume, but they will likely look to upgrade their pass catchers this offseason. Slayton profiles as an NFL back-up moving forward who is unlikely to have much fantasy relevance.
,-6.80
273,CHI,Cole Kmet,TE,N/A,5,26.5,84.00,219.00,330.00,536.00,Kmet's production took a step back in 2024 (47-474-4). He's under contract for three more seasons, but we'll have to see how the 26-year-old fits in new HC Ben Johnson's offense after the selection of Round 1 TE Colston Loveland.,-15.00
274,CAR,Jimmy Horn Jr.,WR,N/A,14,23,0.00,218.00,369.00,696.00,A transfer to Colorado in 2023 supplied a chance to play with QB Shedur Sanders. A loaded WR room limited Horn’s production to some degree, but he still managed 95 catches and 1,007 yards from 2023-2024 (13 games). He totaled seven TDs, with only one coming in ‘24. While Horn isn't physically imposing at 5'8, 174 pounds, he's a capable slot option who can win early in the route. Give him a boost in PPR formats.,-8.20
275,LAC,Oronde Gadsden II,TE,N/A,12,22.3,51.00,218.00,400.00,778.00,The son of the former Miami Dolphins’ WR, Gadsden II is the ultimate tweener prospect. He is too big to be a WR, but not quite built enough to be an in-line TE. Gadsden landed in a promising spot without a long-term TE -- and alongside Justin Herbert.,-9.30
276,CAR,Rico Dowdle,RB,N/A,14,27.3,77.00,213.00,338.00,491.00,Dowdle arguably outplayed current Titan Tony Pollard in 2023. The former UDFA returned to Dallas on a 1-year deal last March and proceeded to post a breakout 235-1,079-2 line. He added 39 catches. The issue now is that he’s scheduled for free agency, while Dallas will almost certainly add backfield talent.,2.40
277,KC,Brashard Smith,RB,N/A,10,22.4,30.00,213.00,343.00,615.00,Similar to Tyrone Tracy, Brashard Smith spent most of his collegiate career as a WR. After transferring to SMU from Miami, Smith changed positions to RB and was the central part of their offensive success. Lining up both wide and in the backfield, he is an intriguing weapon with great short area quickness and ability. He is a true sleeper in this deep RB class.,1.90
278,SEA,AJ Barner,TE,N/A,8,23.3,51.00,213.00,363.00,674.00,Barner flashed some receiving talent in 2024, but his value took a hit with the addition of Round 2 TE Elijah Arroyo.,-13.60
279,DAL,Jaydon Blue,RB,N/A,10,21.7,55.00,211.00,340.00,610.00,Blue was expected to be the next big Texas RB after Sophomore CJ Baxter went down with an injury. However, struggles with his vision early in 2024 led to a pass-catching role for the former four-star recruit. Blue ran a 4.38 at the NFL Combine despite nursing a torn muscle in his groin. His 4.25 Pro Day time may be more accurate to his actual speed. As the first RB drafted by the Cowboys, Blue has a golden opportunity to seize playing time next to Javonte Williams
,3.00
280,SEA,Ricky White,WR,N/A,8,23.6,19.00,210.00,349.00,645.00,White initially committed to Michigan State, but was buried on the depth chart in his first two seasons (not even seeing game action in 2021). White is a subpar athlete, running a 4.61 40-time at only 184 pounds, but he makes up for it with sharp cutting technique and great focus catching. His production is intriguing enough to warrant a deep dynasty roster spot, as there's an opening for him to climb Seattle's depth chart.
,-9.00
281,HOU,Dalton Schultz,TE,N/A,6,29.2,85.00,210.00,328.00,528.00,The Texans’ offense regressed in 2024, and Schultz certainly felt the impact. He finished as the TE26 in PPR points per game, with his first TE1 performance not coming until Week 10. He's signed through 2026 and figures to play a limited role going forward. ,-15.60
282,CLE,Shedeur Sanders,QB,N/A,9,23.6,0.00,210.00,354.00,684.00,Sanders' fall to the fifth round changes his NFL potential massively. Sanders looks like he will make the team as a reserve, but won’t start anytime soon. His arm talent at least makes him worth rostering in Superflex leagues.,-40.20
283,ATL,Ray-Ray McCloud,WR,N/A,5,28.9,59.00,208.00,327.00,499.00,McCloud was good enough to stay on the field for the Falcons and have the occasional fantasy relevant game. He is under contract in 2025 and could stick in that role this year.,-9.60
284,TEN,Tyler Lockett,WR,N/A,10,32.9,58.00,208.00,287.00,470.00,Lockett's production fell off last year (49-600-2). He landed in a fine spot for opportunity after signing a one-year deal with Tennessee. Still, there's no dynasty value to chase here.,-11.40
285,CIN,Jake Browning,QB,N/A,10,29.4,186.00,207.00,332.00,518.00,Browning steps in for Joe Burrow this season, but is unlikely to make a strong impact,-36.70

287,GB,Isaiah Neyor,WR,N/A,5,24.3,0.00,205.00,340.00,629.00,Neyor broke out at Wyoming in 2021. The redshirt sophomore led the Cowboys with the following market shares: 27.1% (catches), 41.5% (receiving yards), and 80% (receiving TDs). He recorded a monster 20.0 yards per catch. Last fall, Neyor ranked second on the team in receiving yards and first in TDs. He sat third in targets and fifth in catches, though.,-10.70
288,JAC,Dyami Brown,WR,N/A,8,25.8,69.00,204.00,324.00,581.00,Brown signed a one-year deal with the Jags that can be worth up to $10 million. This comes on the heels of a career-best 2024 -- and the Jags moving on from WR Christian Kirk and TE Evan Engram. WR2/3 targets are available, but Brown won't be guaranteed to stick in Jacksonville beyond this fall.,-8.30
289,KC,Noah Gray,TE,N/A,10,26.3,51.00,204.00,322.00,558.00,Gray took over some of Travis Kelce’s work, scoring five TDs in his last seven games. With rookie Jared Wiley ending up on IR, Gray took advantage. He could see even more work next season, his 26-year-old season, and be a potential heir apparent to Kelce.

290,DAL,KaVontae Turpin,WR,N/A,10,29.1,83.00,200.00,315.00,481.00,Turpin set career highs with 31 catches and 420 yards in 2024. Look for him to stay in a part-time role moving forward.,-9.80
291,NYJ,Allen Lazard,WR,N/A,9,29.8,36.00,199.00,312.00,435.00,Lazard flashed with the Jets and his connection with Aaron Rodgers but ended the season on IR with a chest injury. He is under contract through 2026.,-12.90
292,NO,Brandin Cooks,WR,N/A,11,32,53.00,198.00,274.00,338.00,Cooks dealt with a knee injury in 2024 and underperformed when healthy. He signed with New Orleans in March, garnering a decent-sized contract (2 years, $13 million). It's a decent spot for volume, but Cooks projects as a fantasy reserve going forward.,-14.20
293,WAS,Luke McCaffrey,WR,N/A,12,24.4,56.00,196.00,334.00,608.00,McCaffrey was buried on the depth chart as a rookie, but the Commanders seem to be developing him slowly. There is still upside if he can earn the slot role in his second year.,-8.90
294,CAR,Jonathon Brooks,RB,N/A,14,22.2,0.00,195.00,339.00,565.00,With Bijan Robinson in the pros, Brooks’ time to shine arrived in 2023. And he did, ranking top-10 nationally in yards after contact per attempt and Pro Football Focus’ elusive rating. He proved explosive as a pass-catcher, too. Just one problem: Brooks’ season ended with a November ACL tear. Then, in December of 2024, Brooks tore the same ACL again. He’ll miss the entire 2025 season.,-1.10
295,NE,Antonio Gibson,RB,N/A,14,27.3,41.00,195.00,310.00,450.00,Gibson earned a three-year deal in 2024 with $5.3 million guaranteed. Following a quiet season, he's likely to return as a rotational piece alongside Rhamondre Stevenson in 2025.,-1.70
296,PIT,Will Howard,QB,N/A,5,24,0.00,195.00,329.00,636.00,Howard has generally been a mediocre QB in terms of accuracy and arm strength for most of his career, but he had an outstanding playoff run, throwing for 1,150 yards and eight TDs with two INTs. Howard lands in a good situation on the Steelers to be a potential starter long term, and maybe even find a few starts this year. He has some rushing upside and plenty of experience. If he does end up as the starter someday, he will be a low ceiling/high floor player,-41.50
297,PHI,Will Shipley,RB,N/A,9,23,49.00,193.00,305.00,548.00,Shipley packs an all-around game into a 5’11, 210-pound frame. His pass-catching ability should excite you for fantasy. He caught 84 balls for his career and averaged 7 yards after the catch per reception. Landing spot is a clear issue, though. Saquon Barkley will stick around for 1-2+ more seasons.,-0.10
298,MIA,Quinn Ewers,QB,N/A,12,22.5,0.00,193.00,330.00,666.00,Ewers was one of the best QB recruits of all time, but he could never pull off consistent play at Texas. He threw for a modest 3,189 yards, 29 TDs, and 11 INTs, despite Texas transferring in top WR talent. Ewers could be a long-term option for the Dolphins if Tua Tagovailoa gets injured again and they want a young player with upside to develop

299,CHI,Roschon Johnson,RB,N/A,5,24.6,43.00,192.00,294.00,495.00,Johnson doesn’t have much tread off his tires after playing behind Bijan Robinson at Texas. His limited sample showed a tough, hard-nosed rusher with pass protection chops. At 6’0, 220 pounds, Johnson also posted solid testing numbers at the 2022 Combine. He simply never took over the backfield as a rookie, and he failed to steal much work from D'Andre Swift in Year 2. A 2025 breakout is unlikely.,-1.60
300,WAS,Zach Ertz,TE,N/A,12,34.8,104.00,191.00,258.00,448.00,Ertz instantly connected with Jayden Daniels and put up some great fantasy numbers in 2024. He was the PPR TE10 in points per game and finished eight games as a TE1. Of course, Ertz will turn 35 during the 2025 season, so this is unlikely to sustain. Even so, he may have one more good year in him.,-19.90
301,MIA,Malik Washington,WR,N/A,12,24.9,83.00,189.00,303.00,551.00,Washington dealt with a leg injury early in the season and couldn’t really break through, even with play time. He still has potential and could slide into the WR3 role for the Dolphins in 2025.,-9.30
302,CHI,Olamide Zaccheaus,WR,N/A,5,28.2,44.00,189.00,297.00,494.00,Zaccheaus set career highs in catches, yards, and TDs per game in 2024. His dynasty outlook is clouded by impending free agency.,-12.50
303,CIN,Noah Fant,TE,N/A,10,27.8,61.00,189.00,293.00,494.00,Fant finished as the TE29 in points per game in 2024. Now, he’ll adjust to a new QB (Sam Darnold) and OC (Klint Kubiak) ahead of a contract season. He’ll also face stiff target competition from athletic Round 2 TE Elijah Arroyo.,-21.00

305,JAC,LeQuint Allen,RB,N/A,8,21.1,36.00,187.00,294.00,504.00,Allen had his background looked into deeply by the NFL after having an assault charge dismissed and expunged from his record. With that aside, he has two straight 1,000-yard rushing seasons and 102 receptions over that period. His multi-faceted skill set makes him a deep dynasty sleeper. The landing spot simply doesn’t lend itself to early-career opportunities.,-1.90

307,CIN,Jermaine Burton,WR,N/A,10,24.2,28.00,182.00,315.00,585.00,It was a nightmare rookie season for Burton, between missing meetings, not traveling with the team due to assault allegations, and not performing on the field. He was also beat out by 2023 sixth-round pick Andrei Iosivas. Burton is young and still has a chance, but Tee Higgins' long-term deal provides a huge roadblock to production.,-11.50
308,CLE,Jerome Ford,RB,N/A,9,26,60.00,178.00,259.00,367.00,Nick Chubb's season-ending injury allowed Ford to emerge in year two (200-813-4, plus 44-319-5 receiving). Ford mustered 5.4 YPC in 2024 but saw limited scoring chances on a poor Cleveland offense. Ford could be a rotational piece again in 2025, as Chubb will likely move on.,-4.10

318,SF,Demarcus Robinson,WR,N/A,14,31,37.00,172.00,262.00,334.00,Robinson continues to flash at times, but he wasn’t able to secure the top WR position in 2024 when both Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp were injured. ,-16.70
319,TB,Tez Johnson,WR,N/A,9,23.3,30.00,169.00,287.00,542.00,Johnson looked like an absolute stud in 2023 with 86 catches for 1,182 yards and 10 TDs. He outperformed Troy Franklin, running a more nuanced route tree and connecting with QB Bo Nix. Johnson took a step back in 2024, but he still led the team with 83 catches for 898 yards and 10 TDs. Small, thin, and fast, Johnson ultimately dropped to Round 7 of the NFL Draft. He’s blocked by a deep Bucs WR corps.,-13.60
320,DET,Dominic Lovett,WR,N/A,8,22.8,11.00,166.00,282.00,532.00,Lovett led Missouri in catches (56) and receiving yards (846) as a sophomore in 2022. That represented 22.3% and 30.4% market shares, respectively. The production came alongside WR Luther Burden, albeit the true freshman version. Lovett’s production flatlined at Georgia over the past two seasons. Still, in 2024, he led a squad that lost Brock Bowers and Ladd McConkey to the NFL in catches (59) and receiving yards (607). Primarily a slot, Lovett proved capable of uncovering on short routes. He can be bullied at the catch point, though, and brings average size to the NFL.,-14.90

322,BAL,Justice Hill,RB,N/A,7,27.8,73.00,165.00,260.00,349.00,2023 turned up career highs across the board for Hill, who benefited from J.K. Dobbins' season-ending injury. Lightly used on the ground in 2024, Hill still managed to set a career-high with 42 catches. He's under contract through the 2026 season but will continue playing a small role as long as Derrick Henry’s around.,-4.30

The former Steeler made a minimal impact, though. Even after returning on a one-year deal, Smith-Schuster is only worth holding in deep formats.,-17.40
327,BUF,Kaden Prather,WR,N/A,7,23,11.00,162.00,275.00,519.00,Prather went from the top WR at West Virginia to playing second fiddle to Tai Felton at Maryland. A downgrade at QB caused a slight decrease of production, but Prather is a big, rangy athlete who is also a sharp route runner. Though he has never cleared more than 700 yards receiving in a single season, he has the traits to stick in Buffalo.
,-15.40
328,MIA,Andrew Armstrong,WR,N/A,12,24.8,0.00,162.00,260.00,473.00,Armstrong impresses as a pure specimen on the field. Big, long and athletic. This was even more apparent when he played at East Texas A&M for his first four seasons. He still is fairly raw and needs to be much more consistent as a route runner and hands catcher, but the production in the SEC along with his build makes for an interesting sleeper. ,-17.20
329,NYG,Jameis Winston,QB,N/A,14,31.7,0.00,159.00,235.00,311.00,Winston took over for Deshaun Watson around midseason and showed his typical hot-and-cold tendencies. Odds are against him starting more than a couple of games in 2025.,-47.10
330,CAR,Mitchell Evans,TE,N/A,14,22.5,26.00,156.00,286.00,557.00,A torn ACL cut a promising 2023 season short for Evans, who was building buzz for the NFL Draft. The in-line two-way TE came back strong in 2024, but lost a bit of a step. His toughness and intelligence shine through, especially when high-pointing passes or finding holes in the zone. Evans' best days may be yet to come. ,-24.60
331,HOU,Luke Lachey,TE,N/A,6,24.2,1.00,156.00,252.00,452.00,In 2022, Lachey tallied 28-398-4 alongside Sam LaPorta. Lachey ranked third among Hawkeyes in catches, second in yards, and first in TDs. A setback hit in 2023, as he suffered an ankle injury that required surgery. Note that Lachey totaled 10-131 in less than three full games prior to the injury. His production failed to rebound last fall, but teams should remain interested in Lachey based off the 2022 tape. Consider him a developmental TE with a shot at starting within 2-3 years.,-30.00
332,NYJ,Isaiah Davis,RB,N/A,9,23.6,24.00,154.00,232.00,306.00,Davis has been among the most productive college RBs since 2022, posting 3,029 yards and 33 TDs on 485 carries. The lower level of competition surely helped, but his tape features a nice combo of power, patience, and vision. It's hard to put a positive spin on his landing spot, though. While he flashed in 2024, he’ll battle Braelon Allen for RB2 snaps for as long as Breece Hall sticks around.,-8.10
333,BAL,LaJohntay Wester,WR,N/A,7,23.4,0.00,153.00,260.00,490.00,Wester’s production ticked up from 2022-2023 with 169 catches, 1,882 yards, and 16 TDs. He primarily played in the slot. Next came a transfer to Colorado and a chance to play with QB Shedeur Sanders. Wester ranked a clear second behind Travis Hunter in catches (74), yards (931), and TDs (10). He remained a slot target. Wester’s speed was just OK relative to his size at the Combine. The tape shows a smooth mover, but he’s simply unlikely to develop into a high-volume target as a pro.,-17.20
334,TEN,Kalel Mullings,RB,N/A,10,22.9,14.00,151.00,239.00,428.00,Mullings took over the lead job at Michigan and never looked back. He is massive with explosion and punishes defenders who try to tackle him one-on-one. Won’t add anything in the receiving game, but could contribute on the ground consistently with some growth. ,-7.00
335,MIA,Darren Waller,TE,N/A,12,33,79.00,151.00,219.00,356.00,Waller retired ahead of the 2024 season. Before then, he struggled with injuries as a Raider and Giant from 2021-2023. He last posted consistent TE1 totals in 2020. At 33 (in September), we're not betting on a major rebound. Note that he's only under contract for 2025.,-28.40
336,ARI,Greg Dortch,WR,N/A,8,27.3,23.00,150.00,237.00,409.00,Dortch didn’t do much in 2024, ceding the slot role to Marvin Harrison Jr. It’s possible he ends up batling for a roster spot in 2025.,-18.20
337,NE,CJ Dippre,TE,N/A,14,23.3,0.00,150.00,255.00,475.00,Dippre transferred out of Maryland ahead of the 2023 season. He chose Alabama over Ohio State in the transfer portal, although big time production never followed (32 catches, 441 yards, and 0 TDs over the past two seasons). Dippre ultimately checks boxes for size and play strength. After a solid Combine, he should start out as a depth piece.,-30.10

340,BUF,Curtis Samuel,WR,N/A,7,29.1,33.00,146.00,229.00,388.00,Samuel had some hype joining the Bills, but he failed to make much of an impact in 2024. He's under contract through 2026 but won't be guaranteed to stick on the roster that long.

342,PIT,Roc Taylor,WR,N/A,5,22.9,0.00,142.00,241.00,454.00,After two quiet seasons, Taylor’s production exploded as a 2023 junior at Memphis. He tallied team highs in catches (69) and receiving yards (1,083). The yardage marked a nice 27.2% team share, while Taylor added a strong 2.60 yards per route run. The Alabama native remained steady as an outside WR in 2024. He wasn’t as elusive after the catch – but note his boosted use as a downfield threat (14.5-yard aDOT). Taylor confirmed that speed with a 4.49 (at 213 pounds) at the combine. ,-18.90
343,LVR,Aidan O'Connell,QB,N/A,8,27,0.00,142.00,229.00,408.00,O'Connell made several starts in 2024, but he’ll slide into a backup role after Vegas traded for Geno Smith.,-46.90

A bit of a plodder, but he is explosive enough to make an NFL roster. Being added to an open Cowboys depth chart could give Mafah room to make the roster.,-7.10
345,BAL,Devontez Walker,WR,N/A,7,24.3,36.00,138.00,229.00,423.00,Walker totaled one Week 15 catch as a rookie. Despite enticing height/weight/speed, he projects no higher than Baltimore's WR4 in the short term.,-18.00

348,SEA,Damien Martinez,RB,N/A,8,21.6,1.00,136.00,211.00,356.00,Martinez transferred from Oregon State to Miami and had a solid year for the Hurricanes: 1,002 rushing yards and 10 TDs. Martinez also added another 204 yards through the air. A tough, balanced runner, Martinez looked like a future lead back on tape. But he shockingly dropped to Round 7, making him a fantasy long shot.,-10.00

The Cornhuskers passed more in 2024, helping Fidone set career highs in catches (36), yards (373), and yards per route run (1.41). Ultimately, he brings NFL-caliber length and athleticism. We’re simply working with a limited college sample here.,-32.70
