    description: |
      Projection variance mart - compare actual performance vs pre-game projections.

      **Grain**: One row per player per season per week (actuals grain)
      **Sources**:
      - mrt_real_world_actuals_weekly (actual performance)
      - mrt_real_world_projections (weekly projections)

      **Analysis Focus**:
      - Variance = actual - projected for each stat
      - Only includes projections made BEFORE the game (asof_date <= game week)
      - Focuses on weekly projections (horizon='weekly')
      - Regular season only (season_type='REG')
      - Uses latest projection available before each week

      **Use Cases**:
      - Projection accuracy analysis by position/player
      - Identify consistent over/under performers
      - Adjust future projection models
      - Evaluate projection source quality

      **Future Enhancements** (per model comments):
      - Track multiple projection snapshots per week
      - Add percentage error, absolute error metrics
      - Aggregated accuracy by position/source
