           SLEEPER API IDP PROJECTION INVESTIGATION SUMMARY
================================================================================

OBJECTIVE: Test Sleeper API's actual IDP projection capabilities

DATE: October 29, 2025

================================================================================
                             FINAL VERDICT
================================================================================

  ❌ NOT VIABLE for IDP Projections
  ✅ VIABLE for IDP Historical Stats

================================================================================
                            KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

✅ WORKING - Historical Stats Endpoint
   URL: /v1/stats/nfl/regular/{season}/{week}
   • 974+ defensive players per week
   • 67 IDP stat fields (tackles, sacks, INTs, etc.)
   • High quality data

   • Returns 6,957 empty arrays
   • No projection data for any player
   • Unusable for fantasy analysis

                     COMPARISON TO OTHER SOURCES
================================================================================

Source              Projections   Historical   Cost      Quality
------------------------------------------------------------------
Sleeper API         ❌ NO         ✅ YES       Free      Good
ESPN IDP            ✅ YES        ✅ YES       Free      Fair
FantasyPros IDP     ✅ YES        ✅ YES       Paid      Excellent
PFF                 ✅ YES        ✅ YES       Expensive Outstanding

================================================================================
                          RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

DO NOT integrate Sleeper API for IDP projections.

Consider Sleeper for:
  ✅ Historical IDP stats analysis
  ✅ Backtesting fantasy models
  ✅ Player performance tracking
  ✅ Training data for custom projection models

For IDP projections, use:
  • ESPN IDP Rankings (free)
  • FantasyPros IDP API (paid)
  • Custom model built on Sleeper historical data

                         NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. ❌ Do NOT build Sleeper IDP projection integration
2. ✅ Evaluate ESPN or FantasyPros as projection sources
3. ✅ Consider custom projection model using Sleeper historical stats
4. ✅ Document decision in project architecture docs
