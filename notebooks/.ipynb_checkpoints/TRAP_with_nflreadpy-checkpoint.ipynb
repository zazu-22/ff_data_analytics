    "# TRAP (Trivial Rush Attempt Percentage) with **nflreadpy** (Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook reproduces the **TRAP** model popularized by Ben Gretch and demonstrated on Open Source Football — but in Python — using the **nflreadpy** package from the nflverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition (working):** TRAP measures the share of a player's **total touches** that are **low-value rush attempts** — specifically, rush attempts **outside the opponent's 10-yard line**. Formally:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{TRAP} = \\frac{\\text{Rush Attempts outside Opp 10}}{\\text{Rush Attempts} + \\text{Receptions}} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "> Intuition: touches that *aren't* inside-the-10 rushes or receptions tend to be less valuable for fantasy scoring. A high TRAP suggests a player may be soaking up empty-calorie carries.\n",
