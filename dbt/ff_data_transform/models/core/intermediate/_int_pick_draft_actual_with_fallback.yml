      Draft Picks with Fallback Logic - Ensures complete base pick coverage.

      Grain: One row per base pick (12 picks per round)
      Source: int_pick_draft_actual (actual) + int_pick_base (fallback)

      Provides base picks with fallback to generated picks for incomplete drafts.

      Current State (v2 Phase 3):
      - No actual draft transaction data (rookie_draft_selection)
      - Uses generated base picks from int_pick_base for all rounds
      - pick_source = 'GENERATED' for all picks

      Future State (when actual draft data available):
      - Use actual draft data for complete rounds (12 base picks)
      - Fall back to generated picks for incomplete rounds
      - pick_source = 'ACTUAL' for draft data, 'GENERATED' for fallback
