## 1. Team State Assessment Frameworks

### 1.1 The Competitive Lifecycle Framework

**Source:** [Footballguys - Rebuilding or Contending: The Dynasty Lifecycle](https://www.footballguys.com/article/2025-rebuilding-or-contending-the-dynasty-lifecycle)

**Core Concept:**
Dynasty teams exist in one of three states: **Contending**, **Fringe/Purgatory**, or **Rebuilding**. The most critical skill is accurately identifying your current state and committing to the appropriate strategy.

**Three States Defined:**

#### State 1: Contending (Win-Now Mode)

**Indicators:**

- Projected top-4 finish in league standings
- Roster features multiple proven producers in prime years
- Competitive starting lineup across all positions

**Strategy:**

- Trade future picks for proven players
- Target players entering or in prime production years
- Prioritize immediate impact over long-term potential
- Be aggressive acquiring RBs to fill gaps

**Timeline:** 1-2 year championship window

#### State 2: Purgatory (The Worst Place to Be)

**Indicators:**

- Projected middle-of-pack finish (5th-8th place)
- Mix of aging veterans and unproven youth
- Not strong enough to contend, not weak enough for top picks

**Problem:**
"The absolute worst spot in a dynasty league" - neither competing for championships nor accumulating premium draft capital.

**Strategy:**

- **Make a decisive choice:** Either commit to win-now push OR commit to full rebuild
- Avoid half-measures that keep you stuck in mediocrity
- If projected record suggests non-contention, blow it up early (Weeks 4-6)

**Source:** [Draft Sharks - Escape Fantasy Purgatory](https://www.draftsharks.com/article/escape-fantasy-purgatory-with-this-dynasty-strategy)

#### State 3: Rebuilding

**Indicators:**

- Projected bottom-4 finish
- Lack of proven producers at key positions
- Young roster with mainly developmental assets

**Strategy:**

- Accumulate draft picks across multiple classes (2-3 year supply)
- Focus on 2-3 young foundational pieces (WR/QB priority)
- Avoid rostering RBs (they'll age out before window opens)
- Trade all aging assets at peak value

**Timeline:** 2-3 years until competitive window opens

**Critical Decision Point:**
Week 4-6 provides the clearest signal for which state your team occupies. Earlier you commit to appropriate strategy, better your outcomes.

### 1.2 The 2-3 Year Window Strategy

**Source:** [Dynasty Nerds - 2-3 Year Window](https://www.dynastynerds.com/strategy/dynasty-trade-secrets-2-3-year-window/)

**Philosophy:**
"A strategy mindset that balances winning early with sustainable competitiveness in the near future."

**Core Principle:**
Not all-in for this year, not rostering every rookie - building to win soon and stay strong rather than making risky all-in pushes or endlessly rebuilding.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Target players in years 2-4 of NFL career
- Avoid expensive aging veterans with 1-2 year windows
- Avoid raw rookies who won't contribute immediately
- Build roster that can compete now while maintaining 2-3 year viability

**Sweet Spot Players:**

- Young producers entering year 3-4 (breakout timing)
- Proven players ages 24-26 (peak production years)
- High-upside sophomores showing year 2 growth

**Avoid:**

- Players 30+ (likely to decline within window)
- Unproven rookies (may take 2-3 years to contribute)
- Injury-prone veterans (unreliable for sustained run)

**Advantage:**
Maximizes competitive years while maintaining roster health - you're competitive multiple years rather than one boom-or-bust season.

### 1.3 The Evergreen Strategy

**Source:** [Footballguys Forums - Evergreen Strategy](https://forums.footballguys.com/threads/general-dynasty-strategy-evergreen.809394/)

**Philosophy:**
"Always be competitive. No rebuilds (that's the plan, at least)."

**Core Tactics:**

1. Maximize team's dynasty value at all times
2. Sell out of any RB before cliff (typically year 5+)
3. Keep your top-value guys regardless of age
4. Trade depth and middling guys for draft picks whenever possible
5. Fill holes via waivers and late-round picks
6. Never tank - always try to win

**Position Management:**

- **RBs:** Exit early, often (before year 5 cliff)
- **WRs:** Hold young studs, trade aging depth pieces
- **QBs:** Maintain 2-3 startable options in Superflex
- **Picks:** Constantly replenish by trading mid-tier players

**Philosophy:**
Rejects traditional rebuild cycles in favor of constant roster optimization. Requires active management and willingness to trade frequently.

**Limitation:**
Difficult to execute without deep manager engagement and active trade partners. Requires accepting competitive years rather than championship-dominant years.

## 2. Positional Draft Strategy Frameworks

### 2.1 Zero RB Strategy

**Sources:**

- [The League Winners - Dynasty Zero RB](https://theleaguewinners.com/dynasty-startup-strategy-zero-rb/)
- [Fantasy Football Counselor - Zero RB 2025](https://thefantasyfootballcounselor.com/zero-rb-strategy-for-fantasy-football-2025-does-it-still-work/)
- [Fantasy Footballers - Misunderstood Zero RB](https://www.thefantasyfootballers.com/analysis/the-misunderstood-zero-rb-strategy-an-open-letter-fantasy-football/)

**Definition:**
Skip running backs in the first 4-5 rounds, loading up on pass-catchers (WR/TE) and quarterbacks (in Superflex) before targeting RBs in middle-to-late rounds.

**Core Philosophy:**
"Ignore running back completely in the early rounds, but stockpile backs in the later rounds—hoping that when the expected injury chaos of the position kicks in league-wide, you'll be well equipped to benefit."

**Dynasty-Specific Application:**

**Strategic Rationale:**

1. **Injury avoidance:** RBs have highest injury rate - avoid paying premium for injury risk
2. **Age curves:** RBs decline fastest - early picks become liabilities soonest
3. **Opportunity volatility:** RB roles change frequently due to injury, performance, coaching
4. **WR stability:** WRs maintain value longer, providing stable foundation

**Implementation:**

- Rounds 1-5: Target elite WRs (ages 24-27), top TEs, QB (in Superflex)
- Rounds 6-10: Begin selecting RBs with high upside/opportunity
- Rounds 11+: Continue stockpiling RB depth and handcuffs

**Success Metrics:**

- Adoption has grown from 7% → 34% of Underdog Fantasy teams over recent years
- Success requires active waiver management and willingness to stream RBs

**When It Works:**

- Deep leagues where RB scarcity creates waiver opportunity
- Leagues with active waivers and roster flexibility
- When early RB picks suffer expected injury attrition

**When It Fails:**

- Elite RBs stay healthy and dominate
- Late-round RB lottery tickets don't hit
- Waiver wire provides insufficient replacement options

### 2.2 Robust RB Strategy

**Sources:**

- [FantasyPros - Dynasty Robust RB](https://www.fantasypros.com/2024/05/dynasty-draft-strategy-robust-rb-fantasy-football/)
- [Fantasy Six Pack - RB Draft Strategies](https://fantasysixpack.net/dynasty-football-rb-draft-strategies-zero-rb-hero-rb/)

**Definition:**
Draft two elite RBs in first 2-3 rounds, dominating the scarcest position.

**Core Philosophy:**
"At least your first two picks should be a running back, maybe even the first three selections."

**Strategic Rationale:**

1. **Positional scarcity:** RB is thinnest position with steepest drop-off
2. **Competitive advantage:** Dominate opponents at scarcest position
3. **Championship necessity:** Elite RBs are difference between good teams and champions
4. **Injury insurance:** Multiple elite RBs provides depth when one goes down

**Dynasty Considerations:**

**Benefits:**

- Secure elite production at scarcest position
- Can afford injury/risk to one RB with depth
- Enables aggressive targeting of young upside RBs
- Creates trade leverage (teams desperate for RBs will overpay)

**Risks:**

- Shortest shelf-life position - roster ages quickly
- Multiple early picks can bust simultaneously
- Miss opportunities at more stable positions (WR)
- Difficult to sustain long-term without constant replenishment

**Optimal Target Profile:**

- RBs ages 22-24 (early in career arc)
- Bellcow usage with passing game role
- Strong offensive line/offensive scheme
- Proven NFL production (not rookie speculation)

**Exit Strategy:**
Critical for dynasty - must sell RBs before year 5 cliff. Use depth to continuously flip aging pieces for younger replacements.

### 2.3 Hero RB (Anchor RB) Strategy

**Sources:**

- [Fantasy Football Counselor - Ultimate RB Strategy Guide](https://thefantasyfootballcounselor.com/the-ultimate-fantasy-football-rb-draft-strategy-guide-2025-zero-rb-vs-hero-rb-vs-robust-rb/)
- [Footballguys - RB Draft Strategy](https://www.footballguys.com/article/2025-fantasy-draft-strategy-guide-running-backs)

**Definition:**
Draft one elite "hero" RB in rounds 1-2, then pivot to WRs, TE, QB before returning to RBs later.

**Core Philosophy:**
"Middle ground between Robust RB and Zero RB."

**Strategic Rationale:**

- Secure one elite RB (top-10/12) as anchor
- Fill out WRs, TE, QB with proven options
- Return to RB in middle rounds for depth/upside plays

**Dynasty Application:**

**Advantages:**

1. **Balance:** No glaring weakness at any position
2. **Flexibility:** One elite RB + late-round upside plays
3. **Stability:** Strong foundation at WR prevents over-reliance on RB
4. **Risk mitigation:** Not overexposed to RB injury/decline risk

**Target Profile for "Hero" RB:**

- Age 23-25 (sweet spot)
- 3-down role with goal-line work
- Passing game involvement (PPR value)
- Established NFL producer (not rookie)

**Complementary Strategy:**
After securing hero, target:

- 2-3 elite WRs (rounds 2-5)
- Top TE if available (round 3-5)
- QB in Superflex (round 2-4)
- Multiple RB lottery tickets (rounds 6-10)

**Dynasty Longevity:**
Most sustainable approach - one elite RB provides anchor while WR foundation maintains long-term value. Easier to replace one aging RB than full stable.

### 2.4 Modified Best Ball/Antifragile Approach

**Source:** [PlayerProfiler - Best Ball Tournament Strategy](https://www.playerprofiler.com/article/best-ball-tournament-strategy/)

**Philosophy:**
Build roster resilient to uncertainty rather than predicting specific outcomes.

**Dynasty Adaptation:**

**Core Principles:**

1. **Diversification over concentration:** Spread risk across multiple players
2. **Upside over floor:** Target players with league-winning upside
3. **Late-round volume:** Prioritize opportunity metrics over talent in late rounds
4. **Stacking strategies:** Pair QB with pass-catchers for correlation
5. **Injury immunity:** Roster construction absorbs injuries without catastrophic failure

**Application to Dynasty:**

- Don't overinvest in any single position
- Maintain 4-5 RBs (hedge injury risk)
- Roster 6-8 WRs (maximize weekly ceiling)
- Target high-variance players (boom/bust profiles)
- Build bench around upside, not safe floors

## 3. Analytical Platforms & Methodologies

### 3.1 KeepTradeCut (KTC) Framework

**Source:** [KeepTradeCut Trade Calculator](https://keeptradecut.com/trade-calculator)

**Core Mechanism:**

**The Keep-Trade-Cut Algorithm:**
Users rank three players of similar value:

- **Keep:** Most valuable player
- **Trade:** Second in value
- **Cut:** Least valuable player

**Data Scale:**

- 23+ million submitted rankings
- Real-time updates with every submission
- Continuous crowdsourced valuation

**Technical Implementation:**

**Adapted ELO Algorithm:**
Processes all submitted rankings using modified ELO rating system to calculate player values following reasonable distribution across value spectrum.

**League Settings:**

- Default format: 12-team, 0.5 PPR
- Available formats: 1QB and Superflex
- Rankings assume "in a vacuum" evaluation (ignore roster construction)

**Value Adjustment Feature:**

**Definition:**
KTC applies "value adjustment" to trades involving multiple players on one side, accounting for roster spot scarcity.

**Calculation:**
Trade considered equal when sum of raw adjustment values on both sides equals. Consolidation trades require premium (3-for-1 costs more than sum of individual values).

**Source:** [How KTC Value Adjustment Works](https://www.javelinfantasyfootball.com/2022/09/30/how-the-ktc-adjustment/)

**Advantages:**

- Captures real-time market sentiment
- Self-correcting based on league-wide consensus
- Reflects actual trade values managers will accept

**Limitations:**

- Susceptible to hype cycles and recency bias
- Values lag behind sudden changes (injuries, trades)
- Crowdsourced = average opinion, may not reflect optimal value

### 3.2 DynastyProcess Analytical Framework

**Sources:**

- [DynastyProcess.com](https://dynastyprocess.com/)

- Starting lineup: QB/RB/RB/WR/WR/TE/FLEX/FLEX

**Rookie Pick Valuation:**
Pick value = weighted average of nth-highest player from recent draft classes (2015-2018).

**Example:**

- 1.03 pick = average value of 3rd-best player from last 4 classes
- Weighting: Recent classes weighted more heavily

**Future Picks:**
Discounted to 80% of current year value (time-value adjustment).

**Customization Options:**

- QB scoring (1QB vs Superflex)
- Startup trade mode
- Rookie pick optimism slider
- League depth preferences

#### 3.2.2 Crystal Ball Tool

**Purpose:**
Predicts season finish by analyzing All-Play Percentage - determines if you should rebuild or push all-in.

**Methodology:**

- Simulates rest of season based on current roster strength
- Calculates probability of playoff appearance
- Recommends strategic direction based on championship probability

#### 3.2.3 Ranking Builder

**Purpose:**
Build custom rankings and compare to consensus FP ranks.

**Application:**

- Identify personal value divergences from market
- Create league-specific rankings accounting for scoring/roster
- Export for draft preparation

#### 3.2.4 R Programming Tools

**Infrastructure:**

- API access to MFL, Sleeper, Fleaflicker, ESPN, Yahoo
- Authentication and rate-limiting handling
- Returns tidy dataframes for analysis

### 3.3 Draft Sharks Machine Learning Methodology

**Source:** [Draft Sharks Dynasty Trade Value](https://www.draftsharks.com/trade-value-chart/dynasty/ppr)

**Core Approach:**
Machine learning trained on all NFL data since 1999 (25+ years of historical data).

**Baseline Calculation:**
Weighted average of:

- Current year projection (highest weight)
- Last two seasons actual performance

**Forecasting Model:**

**Time Horizons:**

- 1-year projection
- 3-year projection
- 5-year projection
- 10-year projection

**Weighted Average:**
Combines all time horizons using proprietary weighting that emphasizes nearer years.

**Key Inputs:**

1. **Performance aging curves by position:**

   - RB: Steep decline post-year 5
   - WR: Gradual decline starting late-20s
   - TE: Stable through year 7
   - QB: Stable into mid-30s

2. **Retirement rates:**

   - Position-specific career length distributions
   - Injury history impact on longevity
   - Performance decline thresholds triggering retirement

**Cross-Positional Algorithm:**
Adjusts values based on exact league setup and scoring settings to enable cross-position comparisons.

**Advantages:**

- Scientifically-sound aging curves from large dataset
- Accounts for realistic retirement probabilities
- Customizable to league scoring and roster settings

**Methodology Type:**
Supervised machine learning (likely regression-based given continuous output values).

### 3.4 PlayerProfiler Advanced Metrics Framework

**Source:** [PlayerProfiler - Advanced Stats Glossary](https://www.playerprofiler.com/terms-glossary/)

**Core Philosophy:**
"Metrics that Matter" - focus on predictive indicators rather than lagging fantasy points.

**Key Metrics Categories:**

#### 3.4.1 Opportunity Metrics

**Target Share:**
Percentage of team's total targets a player receives. Highly predictive for pass-catchers.

**Opportunity Share:**
Combined percentage of team's carries + targets. Most comprehensive volume metric.

**Snap Share:**
Percentage of offensive snaps player was on field. Leading indicator of usage.

**Route Participation:**
Percentage of team's pass plays where player ran route (WR-specific).

#### 3.4.2 Efficiency Metrics

**Yards Per Route Run (YPRR):**
Receiving yards divided by routes run. Isolates receiver efficiency from volume.

- 3.0+ YPRR = elite
- 2.0-3.0 = above average
- \<2.0 = below average

**Weighted Opportunity Rating (WOPR):**
Combines target share and air yards share into single metric. "Most predictive statistic for evaluating receivers."

**True Yards Per Carry (True YPC):**
Adjusts YPC by removing long outlier runs to show consistent efficiency.

**Juke Rate:**
Evaded tackles per touch. Measures elusiveness independent of opportunity.

#### 3.4.3 Expected Value Metrics

**Expected Fantasy Points (xFP):**
Points a player "should" score based on usage, field position, and game script.

**Fantasy Points Over Expected (FPOE):**
Actual fantasy points minus xFP. Measures efficiency relative to opportunity.

- Positive FPOE = efficient (but may regress)
- Negative FPOE = inefficient (but may improve)

**Expected Touchdowns (xTD):**
TDs player "should" score based on quality and location of opportunities.

**Application:**
Players with high xFP but low actual production = buy-low candidates (positive regression expected).
Players with high actual production but low xFP = sell-high candidates (negative regression expected).

## 4. Predictive Metrics for Prospect Evaluation

### 4.1 College Production Metrics

**Sources:**

- [PFF - Predicting Rookie WRs with Dominator Rating](https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-predicting-2022-rookie-wide-receivers-dominator-rating-breakout-age)
- [PlayerProfiler - College Dominator Rating](https://www.playerprofiler.com/article/college-dominator-rating-wide-receiver-nfl-draft-advanced-stats-metrics-analytics-profiles/)

#### 4.1.1 Dominator Rating

**Definition:**

- **WR/TE:** Percentage of team's receiving production (yards + TDs)
- **RB:** Percentage of total offensive production (rushing + receiving)

**Thresholds (WR):**

- **35%+:** Elite - potential team WR1, high-caliber contributor
- **20-35%:** Mid-level talent with situational upside
- **\<20%:** Red flag - limited college production

**Predictive Value:**
Correlation coefficient of 0.22 with NFL yards per year - second only to draft capital (0.29) among individual metrics.

**Application:**
High dominator rating indicates player commanded significant share of college offense, correlating with NFL success.

**Example:**
WR with 40% dominator rating in college = captured 40% of team's receiving yards and receiving TDs, demonstrating dominance over college-level competition.

#### 4.1.2 Breakout Age

**Definition:**
Age at which player first reaches 20% dominator rating.

**Significance:**
Early production (age 19 or younger = elite) indicates player ahead of developmental curve, likely to continue production stretch into NFL.

**Thresholds:**

- **19 or younger:** Elite (84th+ percentile)
- **20-21:** Above average
- **22+:** Concerning (13th percentile or lower)

**Rationale:**
Players who produce at young age against older competition demonstrate advanced development, translating to NFL success more reliably.

**Combined Application:**
Players with high dominator rating AND early breakout age = highest success probability in NFL.

**Example:**
Prospect with 40% dominator rating at age 19 = double-elite signal (high production + early timing).

#### 4.1.3 Market Share Metrics

**Target Share (College):**
Percentage of team targets received in college. Predictive of target competition and alpha receiver ability.

**Yard Share:**
Percentage of team receiving yards. More stable than TD-dependent metrics.

**Reception Market Share:**
Percentage of team receptions. Indicates volume-based role.

### 4.2 NFL Draft Capital as Predictor

**Sources:**

- [Fantasy Footballers - Draft Capital Correlation](https://www.thefantasyfootballers.com/articles/draft-capital-its-correlation-to-early-career-fantasy-production/)
- [Last Word on Sports - Why Draft Capital Matters](https://lastwordonsports.com/nfl/2023/03/30/why-draft-capital-is-the-most-important-thing-in-dynasty-leagues/)

**Core Finding:**
"Draft capital is the single best quantifiable predictor of fantasy success for budding players."

**Position-Specific Hit Rates:**

#### Quarterbacks

- **1st round:** 50% hit rate (top-24 finish), 31% (top-12 finish)
- **2nd round:** 20% (top-24), 13% (top-12) - 2x worse than 1st round
- **3rd+ round:** 0% top-12 finishes in recent 6 draft classes

**Interpretation:** NFL teams' evaluation of QB talent is highly predictive. Draft position matters enormously.

#### Running Backs

- **1st round:** 78.57% hit rate
- **Day 2 (Rounds 2-3):** 46.5% breakout rate
- **Day 3 (Rounds 4-7):** 14.1% hit rate

**Production Gap:**

- 1st round RBs: 13.06 PPR points per game (first 3 seasons)
- Day 2 RBs: 8.59 PPR points per game
- **Difference:** 34% more production from 1st rounders

#### Wide Receivers

- **1st round:** Highest success rates (specific % not provided)
- **2nd round:** 10.71% early-career WR2 rate, 2.38% WR1 rate
- **3rd+ round:** \<1% hit rates for early-career elite production

**Dynasty Rookie Draft Impact:**

- **1.01-1.02 picks:** 80% success rate, nearly double chance of "home run"
- **1.03-1.06 picks:** Still strong hit rates
- **Mid-2nd round+:** Steep decline in success probability

**Strategic Implication:**
NFL draft capital should be primary filter for dynasty prospect evaluation. Players drafted in rounds 1-2 deserve significant premium over day 3 picks regardless of college metrics.

### 4.3 Breakout Age Curves by Position

**Source:** [Fantasy Points - Age Curves](https://www.fantasypoints.com/nfl/articles/2023/age-curves-when-nfl-players-break-out-and-fall-off)

**Running Backs:**

- **60.4%** of breakouts occur between ages 22-24
- **72.6%** of breakouts occur by age 24
- Early opportunity critical - RBs don't suddenly break out at age 26

**Wide Receivers:**

- Most breakouts occur in **Year 2-3** (ages 23-25)
- Year 2 "sophomore surge" well-documented
- Gradual improvement through Year 5

**Tight Ends:**

- Massive leap in **sophomore season** (94% of baseline vs 33% as rookie)
- Year 2-3 = primary breakout window
- Rare for rookie TEs to produce immediately

**Quarterbacks:**

- Variable breakout timing
- Efficiency rises starting age 25
- Peak performance ages 28-33

**Dynasty Application:**

- Don't give up on WRs/TEs after disappointing rookie year - year 2-3 breakout is norm
- RBs who don't produce by year 3 rarely break out later
- QBs require patience - many don't hit stride until mid-20s

### 4.4 Contested Catch Rate & Other Advanced Metrics

**Sources:**

- [Fantasy Trading Room - Predictive Draft Model](<https://www.fftradingroom.com/348/2024-Dynasty-Rookie-Wide-Receiver-Rankings-(6-10)-Based-on-a-Predictive-Draft-Model>)
- [Fantasy Footballers - Predictive Rookie Receiver Metrics](https://www.thefantasyfootballers.com/analysis/predictive-rookie-receiver-metrics-fantasy-football/)

#### Contested Catch Rate

**Definition:**
Percentage of contested targets (defender within 1 yard) resulting in reception.

**Volatility Warning:**
Highly variable year-to-year. Single-season spikes often don't predict NFL performance.

**Example:**
Rome Odunze: 75% contested catch rate in 2023, but only 29.6% prior to 2023 - which is predictive?

**Threshold:**

- **62%+:** Elite ball skills
- **40-60%:** Average
- **\<33%:** Concerning

**Application:**
Use multi-year average rather than single-season peak. Combine with other metrics for validation.

#### Yards Per Route Run (College)

**Definition:**
Receiving yards divided by routes run in final college season.

**Significance:**
"Often the most relevant and best predictor" for WR prospects.

**Thresholds:**

- **3.0+ YPRR:** Elite (translates well to NFL)
- **2.5-3.0:** Above average
- **\<2.5:** Below average efficiency

**Advantage:**
Isolates receiver efficiency from volume (target-dependent stats).

#### Avoided Tackle Rate

**Definition:**
Percentage of touches where player forced missed tackle.

**Application:**
Measures yards-after-catch ability and elusiveness - projectable NFL skill.

#### Speed Metrics

**40-Yard Dash:**
Still relevant but declining importance. NFL performance depends more on:

- Route running
- Separation ability
- Contested catch skills

**Ideal Range:** 4.3-4.5 seconds (WRs)

**Red Flag:** 4.6+ seconds (limits deep-threat role)

## 5. Tanking & Rebuilding Strategies

### 5.1 The Productive Struggle (Intentional Tanking)

**Sources:**

- [RotoWire - Dynasty Tanking & Rebuilding](https://www.rotowire.com/football/article/dynasty-fantasy-tanking-rebuilding-strategies-2025-93401)
- [RotoWire - The Art of Tanking](https://www.rotowire.com/football/article/the-art-of-tanking-in-dynasty-video-70503)

**Definition:**
"Punt" the first year in dynasty league, prioritizing draft picks, younger players, and stable positions over immediate production.

**Philosophy:**
Intentionally finish with poor record to secure premium draft capital, building foundation for sustained competitiveness.

**Key Principles:**

**1. Timing Decision:**
Decide early (Weeks 4-6 provide temperature check). Earlier commitment = better trade market for aging assets.

**2. Position Focus:**

- **Prioritize:** WRs (longest careers), QBs (stable aging curve)
- **Defer:** RBs (will age out before window opens)
- **Target:** TEs in year 2-3 (breakout window approaching)

**3. Draft Pick Accumulation:**

- Target picks across 2-3 draft classes
- Prioritize 1st round picks but don't ignore 2nd rounders
- Future picks often undervalued by contending teams

**4. Asset Management:**

- Trade ALL aging RBs (27+ years old)
- Trade aging WRs only if premium return (they hold value longer)
- Keep young players even if currently unproductive
- Roster injured players on IR (value rebounds post-recovery)

**Expected Timeline:**

- **Year 1:** Full tear-down, accumulate picks
- **Year 2:** Draft talent, begin youth development
- **Year 3:** Competitive window opens with developed young talent

**Critical Success Factor:**
"The real target is the third and fourth seasons" - resist urge to compete in year 2.

### 5.2 Avoiding Common Rebuild Mistakes

**Source:** [Footballguys - Guide to Rebuilding](https://www.footballguys.com/article/2023-dynasty-guide-to-rebuilding)

**Mistake #1: Targeting Only Future Rookie Picks**
**Problem:** Rookies often start slow, extending rebuild by years.

**Solution:** Balance rookie picks with 2nd/3rd year players entering breakout window. Acquire proven young players (ages 23-25) via trade.

**Mistake #2: Delaying Inevitable Decision**
**Problem:** Staying stuck in purgatory, neither contending nor rebuilding.

**Solution:** Honest roster assessment by Week 6. If not top-4, commit to rebuild immediately.

**Mistake #3: Holding Aging RBs**
**Problem:** RBs decline rapidly - will age out before window opens.

**Solution:** Trade ALL RBs 26+ during rebuild. Build through WR/QB instead.

**Mistake #4: Overvaluing Own Players**
**Problem:** Attachment bias prevents selling at optimal value.

**Solution:** Use trade calculators (KTC, DynastyProcess) for objective market values. If player's KTC value is high, sell regardless of personal attachment.

**Mistake #5: Incomplete Teardown**
**Problem:** Half-measures keep you stuck in middle.

**Solution:** Full commitment - trade all win-now pieces, even if painful. Partial rebuilds fail.

### 5.3 The Rebuild Roadmap

**Source:** [The Undroppables - Rebuild Roadmap](https://www.theundroppables.com/the-art-of-dynasty-chapter-18-rebuild-roadmap/)

**Phase 1: Asset Accumulation (Months 1-6)**

**Objectives:**

- Convert aging players to draft picks
- Target 4-6 future 1st round picks
- Acquire 2-3 foundational young pieces (WR/QB)

**Target Trades:**

- Aging RB → 1st + 2nd round pick
- Aging WR → Late 1st or multiple 2nds
- Veteran QB → 1st round pick (in Superflex)

**Avoid:**

- Trading young players for picks (keep foundation)
- Accepting 3rd+ round picks as primary return
- Win-now veterans (they don't fit timeline)

**Phase 2: Rookie Draft Execution (Months 6-12)**

**Objectives:**

- Hit on majority of 1st round picks
- Focus on WR/QB in 1QB, QB-heavy in Superflex
- Avoid RBs unless generational prospect

**Draft Strategy:**

- Use NFL draft capital as primary filter
- Trust 1st round NFL picks at WR/RB
- Be patient with late-round QB/TE upside fliers

**Phase 3: Youth Development (Year 2)**

**Objectives:**

- Allow rookies to develop without pressure
- Continue acquiring picks by trading depth pieces
- Target year 2-3 players entering breakout window

**Key Decisions:**

- Don't panic on disappointing rookie WRs (year 2 surge expected)
- Trade any RBs on final year of rookie contract
- Begin identifying which foundational pieces are "keepers" vs trade chips

**Phase 4: Competitive Window Opening (Year 3+)**

**Objectives:**

- Transition from rebuilding to competing
- Add win-now RBs via trade/draft
- Supplement with proven veterans at value prices

**Aggressive Moves:**

- Now is time to trade picks for players
- Target young elite RBs (ages 23-25)
- Add "cake-topping" veterans to complete roster

**Success Metric:**
Sustained 3-4 year competitive window with roster capable of winning multiple championships.

## 6. Game Theory & Roster Construction

### 6.1 Draft Flow & Adaptive Strategy

**Source:** [Draft Sharks - Best Dynasty Draft Strategy](https://www.draftsharks.com/kb/best-dynasty-draft-strategy)

**Core Principle:**
"Flexibility and adaptability are critical throughout the draft and here's where a bit of game theory can be applied."

**Supply & Demand Dynamics:**

**Concept:**
ADP (Average Draft Position) driven by supply and demand + general number of players drafted at each position.

**Application:**
Real-time league decisions shape your optimal picks. If league over-drafts RBs early, pivot to WR and capture value.

**Causal Inference:**
"Can force us to select a player ahead of ADP or skip entire tiers as the draft unfolds."

**Practical Examples:**

**Scenario 1: RB Run**
League drafts 8 RBs in first 10 picks → WR value skyrockets → Draft WR even if personal rankings favor RB.

**Scenario 2: QB Drought**
In Superflex, if 10 QBs drafted in first 3 rounds → Secure QB2 earlier than planned or risk being locked out.

**Scenario 3: Positional Desert**
If TE position ignored through 5 rounds → Elite TE available represents massive value over replacement → Draft ahead of ADP.

**Strategic Flexibility:**
Don't rigidly adhere to pre-draft plan. React to league behavior and capture value created by positional runs.

### 6.2 Best Player Available (BPA) Philosophy

**Source:** [RotoWire - Dynasty League Strategy](https://www.rotowire.com/football/advice/dynasty-strategy.php)

**Core Principle:**
"Instead of focusing on filling out a starting lineup in a fantasy draft, managers should be accumulating the most fantasy football value possible."

**Implementation:**
Take best player available with every pick, regardless of position or roster construction.

**Rationale:**

1. **Trade market exists** - can always trade surplus at position of strength for position of need
2. **Value compounds** - accumulating high-value players creates trade leverage
3. **Unpredictability** - injuries and breakouts make positional needs fluid
4. **Dynasty timescale** - today's surplus becomes tomorrow's necessity as players age

**When to Violate BPA:**

**Exception 1: Extreme Positional Depth**
If rostering 8 WRs and 1 RB, may need to reach for RB earlier than pure value suggests.

**Exception 2: Superflex QB Scarcity**
Must secure 2-3 QBs or be uncompetitive. Can't BPA if it leaves you with 1 QB in Superflex.

**Exception 3: Trade Deadline Approaching**
If unable to trade for positional need, may need to draft for need in startup.

**General Rule:**
Trust BPA and use trades to address positional imbalances. Draft for value, trade for need.

## 7. Market Timing & Trading Psychology

### 7.1 Sell-High Windows

**Source:** [PlayerProfiler - Dynasty Sell High Candidates](https://www.playerprofiler.com/article/dynasty-fantasy-football-sell-high-candidates/)

**Definition:**
Players whose current dynasty value exceeds their projected future production - optimal time to trade for maximum return.

**Primary Indicators:**

#### Touchdown Over-Performance

Players with significantly positive TDOE (Touchdowns Over Expected) are prime regression candidates.

**Identification:**

- xTD significantly lower than actual TDs
- Career-year TD totals (outlier relative to history)
- Long TD runs inflating totals

**Expected Regression:**
~86% decline in TDOE the following year (historical average).

**Example Archetype:**
RB with 15 TDs on 10.0 xTD = +5.0 TDOE = likely 11-12 TDs next year (regression of ~4 TDs).

#### Career-Year Performance

Players having outlier season relative to career baseline.

**Risk:**
Market prices in career-year as new normal, but regression to career baseline more likely.

**Optimal Timing:**
Sell during offseason following career year when value peaks on recency bias.

#### Age-Based Cliff Approaching

**RBs:** Entering year 5 (age 27)
**WRs:** Age 29-30
**TEs:** Age 30+

**Strategy:**
Sell 1 year before expected decline cliff, not after it's visible.

### 7.2 Buy-Low Windows

**Source:** [Dynasty Nerds - Buy-Low Trade Advice](https://www.dynastynerds.com/dynasty/week-4-fantasy-football-trade-advice-buy-low-sell-high/)

**Definition:**
Players whose current dynasty value is below their projected future production due to temporary suppression.

**Primary Opportunities:**

#### Injury Discount

**Short-term injuries** (4-8 weeks) often create 20-40% value discounts.

**Strategy:**

- Target players on IR with defined return timelines
- Avoid career-threatening injuries (ACL = complicated)
- Buy during injury, hold through recovery

**Recovery Timeline:**
Most players regain 80%+ of pre-injury value within 6 months of return.

#### Negative TD Regression

Players with significantly negative TDOE.

**Identification:**

- xTD significantly higher than actual TDs
- High red zone usage but low TD conversion
- High-quality opportunity without TD results

**Expected Positive Regression:**
~93% improvement in TDOE the following year (historical average).

**Example:**
WR with 4 TDs on 8.5 xTD = -4.5 TDOE = likely 8-9 TDs next year (+4-5 TD boost).

#### Sophomore Slump

Second-year players underperforming rookie season.

**Context:**

- WRs often struggle in year 2 before year 3 breakout
- RBs may lose bellcow role in year 2, regain in year 3
- Market overreacts to single down year

**Strategy:**
Buy sophomore WRs/RBs after disappointing year 2, before year 3 breakout.

#### Offseason Value Lag

Veterans undervalued during offseason "youth movement."

**Timing:**

- Buy proven veterans in April-July (lowest prices)
- Sell in August-September as season approaches (prices recover)

**Targets:**
RBs/WRs ages 27-29 still producing but discounted for age.

### 7.3 The Offseason Pretty Roster Syndrome

**Source:** [Footballguys - Dynasty Investor: Value](https://www.footballguys.com/article/2023-dynasty-investor-intro-to-value)

**Definition:**
During long offseason, managers overvalue youth/upside while undervaluing proven veterans.

**Phenomenon:**

- April-July: "Pretty rosters" of young players with upside command premium
- August-September: Proven producers regain value as season approaches
- Season: Production matters more than upside

**Exploitation Strategy:**

**Phase 1 (Offseason): Sell Youth, Buy Veterans**

- Trade young unproven players at peak hype
- Acquire proven veterans at discount
- Focus on players ages 26-29 (prime production years)

**Phase 2 (Preseason): Value Normalizes**

- Youth premium decreases
- Veteran values recover
- Opportunity to sell veterans acquired in offseason

**Phase 3 (Season): Production Rules**

- Whoever produces gains value
- Age becomes secondary to performance
- Market prices reflect current production

**Application:**
Counter-cyclical trading - buy veterans when market undervalues them (offseason), sell when market overpays (early season).

## 8. Position-Specific Strategy Deep Dives

### 8.1 Wide Receiver: The Foundation

**Sources:**

- [FantraxHQ - Strategy for Building Dynasty Team](https://fantraxhq.com/strategy-for-building-a-dynasty-fantasy-football-team/)
- [FTN Fantasy - Dynasty Strategy Tips](https://ftnfantasy.com/nfl/5-dynasty-strategy-tips)

**Core Philosophy:**
"The basis of any great dynasty roster is the wide receiver position."

**Strategic Rationale:**

**Longevity:**
WRs maintain fantasy relevance 7-10 years (longest of skill positions).

**Aging Curve:**
Gradual decline starting late-20s → manageable roster turnover.

**Value Stability:**
WR values remain stable year-over-year compared to volatile RB values.

**Draft Capital:**
Target WRs early and often regardless of team build.

**Optimal Age Targets:**

- **Startup drafts:** Ages 24-27 (entering or in prime)
- **Rookie drafts:** 1st-2nd round NFL capital
- **Trade targets:** Ages 23-25 (pre-prime acquisition)

**Roster Allocation:**
6-8 WRs for 2-3 WR starting lineup + FLEX options.

**Dynasty-Specific Tactics:**

**Patience with Rookies:**
Year 1 struggles are normal. "Sophomore surge" is real - don't panic sell rookie WRs.

**Buy Sophomore WRs:**
After disappointing rookie seasons, year 2 WRs often undervalued before year 3 breakout.

**Sell at Age 29-30:**
Before steep decline begins (typically year 8-10).

**Target 1st Round NFL Capital:**
WRs drafted rounds 1-2 by NFL teams have dramatically higher hit rates.

### 8.2 Running Back: The Asset Management Challenge

**Sources:**

- [FantasyPros - Dynasty Draft Strategy: RBs](https://www.fantasypros.com/2025/05/dynasty-draft-strategy-rankings-tiers-running-backs-fantasy-football/)
- [Footballguys - RB Draft Strategy Guide](https://www.footballguys.com/article/2025-fantasy-draft-strategy-guide-running-backs)

**Core Philosophy:**
"Dynasty managers should think of running backs as a risky stock such as cryptocurrency."

**Risk Factors:**

1. **Shortest careers** (3-5 year prime)
2. **Highest injury rates**
3. **Rapid decline** (cliff in year 5-7)
4. **Role volatility** (committee backfields common)

**Dynasty-Specific Tactics:**

**"Get In Early, Exit Before Decline"**

- Acquire RBs ages 22-24
- Peak production years 2-4
- Sell after year 4, before year 5 cliff

**Optimal Age Targets:**

- **Draft/Acquire:** Ages 22-24 maximum
- **Peak:** Ages 23-25
- **Sell:** Age 26-27 (before cliff)
- **Avoid:** Age 28+ (steep decline risk)

**Startup Draft Strategy:**
"Avoid the temptation to spend multiple early-round picks on running backs."

**Rationale:**
Multiple early RB picks create ticking time bombs - roster ages rapidly and requires constant expensive replenishment.

**Alternative Approach:**

- Draft 1-2 RBs in startup (Hero RB or late-round lottery)
- Build WR foundation
- Acquire RBs via trade when competitive window opens
- Continuously flip aging RBs for younger replacements

**Target Profile:**

- **Bellcow role** (15+ touches/game)
- **Passing game involvement** (3+ targets/game)
- **Strong O-line** (creates easier rushing lanes)
- **Positive game script** (winning teams run more)

**Roster Allocation:**
4-5 RBs for 2 RB starting lineup - higher turnover requires depth.

### 8.3 Quarterback: Superflex Changes Everything

**Sources:**

- [FantasyPros - Dynasty Startup Draft Strategies](https://www.fantasypros.com/2025/04/14-dynasty-startup-draft-strategies-2025-fantasy-football/)
- [ESPN - The Playbook: Superflex Dynasty](https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/id/45909611/2025-fantasy-football-draft-tips-superflex-dynasty-best-ball-keeper-idp)

**1QB Leagues:**

**Philosophy:**
"Avoid large investments in the quarterback position due to minimal scoring differences and high supply."

**Strategy:**

- Wait on QB (rounds 5-8)
- Stream based on matchups
- Roster 2 QBs maximum

**Rationale:**
QB12 vs QB24 minimal scoring gap (~3 PPG) - not worth early picks.

**Superflex Leagues:**

**Philosophy:**
"Quarterback = most valuable position. The most stable scoring asset."

**Strategic Imperative:**
"If you don't land two quarterbacks in the first six rounds in superflex formats, you're in trouble."

**Optimal Draft Strategy:**

- **Rounds 1-3:** Secure QB1 (elite tier)
- **Rounds 4-6:** Secure QB2 (startable tier)
- **Rounds 7-10:** Consider QB3 (bye week/insurance)

**Rationale:**
Starting 2 QBs in Superflex creates massive positional scarcity. Teams without 2 startable QBs cannot compete.

**Age Considerations:**

**Aging Curve:**

- Peak: Ages 28-33 (longest prime)
- Stable into mid-30s (many productive QBs age 35+)
- Least risky position for veteran acquisition

**Dynasty Strategy:**

- Can safely roster QBs age 30+ for win-now push
- Young QBs (ages 23-26) command massive premium in Superflex
- Late-career QBs often undervalued (34-36) despite continued production

**Roster Allocation (Superflex):**
3-4 QBs minimum - "keep drafting QBs every year even if you have multiple."

**Injury Insurance:**
QB injuries = season-ending in Superflex without depth. Over-roster QBs as insurance.

### 8.4 Tight End: The Sophomore Surge

**Sources:**

- [PFF - Positional Scarcity in Dynasty](https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-positional-scarcity-volatility-dynasty)
- [Footballguys - Dynasty in Practice: How TEs Age](https://www.footballguys.com/article/HarstadDiP20)

**Core Insight:**
"Second-year tight ends show the greatest pattern of year-over-year growth across any skill position."

**The Sophomore Surge:**

- **Rookie season:** 33% of career baseline average
- **Sophomore season:** 94% of career baseline (+98.5% PPR increase)

**Strategic Implication:**
Don't give up on rookie TEs after disappointing year 1. Expect massive year 2 jump.

**Prime Years:**

- Year 3-7: Stable average production
- Don't decline significantly until age 30

**Dynasty Strategy:**

**Acquisition Timing:**
Target TEs in year 2-3 (post-rookie struggle, pre-peak pricing).

**Example Targets:**

- Year 2 TEs who flashed as rookies
- Year 3 TEs entering prime but not yet "elite" priced

**Avoid:**

- Paying premium for rookie TEs (low year 1 hit rate)
- Paying premium for TEs 30+ (decline cliff approaching)

**Roster Allocation:**
2-3 TEs for 1 TE starting lineup - lower priority than WR/RB/QB.

**Premium TE Strategy:**
Elite TEs (Kelce, Andrews, LaPorta tier) command massive value over replacement.

**Value Calculation:**

- TE1-3 vs TE12: ~100+ point gap (similar to RB1 vs RB12)
- Justifies early pick investment for true elite TEs

**Streaming Strategy:**
For non-contenders, streaming TE position and investing premium draft capital in WR/QB is often optimal.

## 9. League Format Considerations

### 9.1 Superflex Dynasty Specifics

**Source:** [RotoBallers - Superflex Startup Strategy](https://www.rotoballer.com/2025-dynasty-startup-strategy-guide/1541666)

**Fundamental Difference:**
QBs become most valuable position, changing entire draft paradigm.

**Draft Strategy Shifts:**

**Round 1-3:**
Should include 2 QBs (your starters). Drafting 3 QBs in first 6 rounds isn't crazy.

**Value Hierarchy:**
Elite QB > Elite RB > Elite WR > QB2 > RB2/WR2

**Startup ADP Changes:**

- Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen: Pick 1-3 range
- Top 12 QBs: All drafted in first 5 rounds
- QB run: Typically rounds 1-4 see 18-20 QBs selected

**Roster Construction:**

- 3-4 QBs minimum
- 4-5 RBs
- 6-7 WRs
- 2-3 TEs

**Trade Value:**
QB trade value in Superflex 2-3x higher than 1QB leagues.

**Rookie Drafts:**
Top QB prospects often 1.01-1.03 picks (in 1QB leagues, fall to late 1st or 2nd).

### 9.2 Tight End Premium (TEP) Leagues

**Impact:**
Increases TE scoring (typically +0.5 to +1.0 PPR bonus for TEs).

**Strategic Shifts:**

**Value Hierarchy:**
Elite TEs move up into late 1st/early 2nd round range (startup drafts).

**Target Adjustment:**
Increases premium for TE position - elite TEs now worth reaching for earlier.

**Roster Construction:**
Consider rostering 3-4 TEs instead of 2-3, as streaming is harder.

### 9.3 Deep League Considerations (14-16 teams)

**Scarcity Effects:**

**Replacement Level:**

- Deeper league = lower replacement level player = higher VoR for starters
- Positions with steepest drop-offs (RB, TE) increase in relative value

**Waiver Wire:**
Essentially barren - can't rely on streaming or picking up breakouts mid-season.

**Strategy Shifts:**

**Depth Premium:**
Roster depth more valuable - can't replace injuries via waivers.

**Handcuff Strategy:**
Rostering RB handcuffs becomes necessity rather than luxury.

**Dart Throw Value:**
Late-round picks hold more value - fewer replacement options available.

**Trade Market:**
Less liquid - fewer trade partners, harder to find win-win structures.

## 10. Implementation Framework

### 10.1 Pre-Draft Preparation

**1. Define League Context:**

- Format: 1QB vs Superflex
- Scoring: Standard, PPR, Half-PPR, TEP
- Roster size: Starting lineup + bench spots
- League size: 10, 12, 14+ teams

**2. Calculate VoR Baselines:**

- Set replacement level by position
- Generate projections with VoR calculations
- Identify positions with steepest drop-offs

**3. Create Tiered Rankings:**

- Group players into value tiers (1-2 round ranges)
- Identify tier breaks (significant value drop-offs)
- Note players you're targeting vs avoiding

**4. Define Draft Strategy:**

- Choose positional approach (Zero RB, Robust RB, Hero RB, BPA)
- Set position targets by round ranges
- Identify pivot points (when to deviate from plan)

**5. Prepare Trade Framework:**

- Calculate pick values using DynastyProcess methodology
- Identify tradeable assets
- Create target list for trade-up/trade-down scenarios

### 10.2 In-Season Management

**1. Weekly Value Monitoring:**

- Track KTC values weekly
- Identify buy-low/sell-high opportunities
- Monitor injury situations for trade opportunities

**2. Roster State Assessment:**

- Every 4-6 weeks: Re-assess competitive status
- Calculate playoff probability
- Determine if state has changed (Contending → Fringe, etc.)

**3. Trade Deadline Strategy:**

- 6-8 weeks before deadline: Begin positioning
- Contenders: Acquire win-now pieces
- Rebuilders: Sell all aging assets
- Fringe: Make definitive choice

**4. Waiver Wire Optimization:**

- Focus on opportunity metrics (snap%, target share)
- Prioritize young players with upside
- Avoid veteran band-aids unless contending

### 10.3 Offseason Process

**1. Rookie Draft Preparation:**

- Study NFL draft capital (primary filter)
- Review college production metrics (dominator, breakout age)
- Create tiered rookie rankings
- Calculate pick values vs player acquisitions

**2. Roster Optimization:**

- Identify aging players to sell (before cliff)
- Target buy-low candidates (injury recovery, TD regression)
- Balance roster across positional allocations
- Ensure 2-3 years of draft capital

**3. Market Timing Exploitation:**

- April-June: Sell youth, buy veterans (offseason pretty roster syndrome)
- July-August: Values normalize
- August: Sell veterans at recovered prices

**4. Competitive Window Planning:**

- Project roster 1-3 years out
- Identify when window opens/closes
- Align acquisitions with timeline
- Avoid win-now moves if window 2+ years away

______________________________________________________________________

## 11. Key Frameworks Summary

### 11.1 Team State Decision Tree

```
1. Calculate projected finish (playoff probability)
   ├─ Top 4 projected → CONTENDING
   ├─ Middle pack (5-8) → PURGATORY (make choice)
   └─ Bottom 4 projected → REBUILDING

2. Contending actions
   ├─ Trade picks for proven players
   ├─ Acquire RBs for immediate window
   ├─ Target players ages 24-28
   └─ Maximize current year roster strength

3. Rebuilding actions
   ├─ Trade all aging assets (RB 26+, WR 29+)
   ├─ Accumulate 4-6 future 1st round picks
   ├─ Build around 2-3 young foundational pieces
   └─ Avoid RBs entirely (will age out)

4. Purgatory resolution
   ├─ Strong core → Convert to contending (add pieces)
   ├─ Weak core → Convert to rebuilding (full tear-down)
   └─ No middle ground - commit to one direction
```

### 11.2 Positional Strategy Selection

```
1. Evaluate league draft flow
   ├─ Heavy early RB runs → Zero RB viable
   ├─ Balanced positional distribution → Hero RB optimal
   └─ WR-heavy early → Robust RB advantage

2. Apply format modifiers
   ├─ Superflex → QB priority overrides all
   ├─ TEP → Elite TE moves into rounds 2-3
   └─ Deep leagues → Depth over stars

3. Execute chosen strategy
   ├─ Zero RB: WR/WR/WR/TE/WR/RB/RB
   ├─ Robust RB: RB/RB/WR/WR/RB/WR
   ├─ Hero RB: RB/WR/WR/WR/RB/WR
   └─ BPA: Highest VoR regardless of position

4. Adapt to draft flow
   ├─ Positional run → Pivot to undervalued position
   ├─ Value falls to you → Take regardless of plan
   └─ Tier break approaching → Trade up if target imminent
```

### 11.3 Trade Evaluation Checklist

```
1. Calculate raw value
   ├─ Sum KTC values of all players
   ├─ Apply quantity premium (30-50% for consolidation)
   └─ Compare to ensure reasonable value exchange

2. Assess timeline fit
   ├─ Acquiring win-now piece as contender → Proceed
   ├─ Acquiring pick/youth as rebuilder → Proceed
   ├─ Timeline mismatch → Reject or adjust

3. Evaluate sustainability
   ├─ Check xTD vs actual TDs (regression risk)
   ├─ Review opportunity metrics (target share, snaps)
   ├─ Consider age vs positional aging curve
   └─ Apply mortality probability if 27+ (RB/WR)

4. Market timing check
   ├─ Buying at value peak → Reconsider
   ├─ Buying at value trough → Green light
   ├─ Selling at value peak → Green light
   └─ Selling at value trough → Reconsider

5. Positional scarcity adjustment
   ├─ Acquiring scarce position (RB/TE) → Accept slight overpay
   ├─ Acquiring deep position (WR) → Demand discount
   └─ Trading from surplus → Accept slight underpay
```
