      Pick Lifecycle Control - Manages TBD → Actual Pick Transitions.

      Grain: One row per pick with lifecycle tracking (primarily TBD picks)
      Source: int_pick_tbd + int_pick_draft_actual

      Tracks lifecycle states of draft picks, especially TBD picks that transition
      to actual picks when draft order is finalized.

      Current State (v2 Phase 4):
      - No actual draft transaction data yet
      - All TBD picks remain in ACTIVE_TBD state
      - Infrastructure ready for future actual draft data

      Future State (when actual draft data available):
      - TBD picks transition to SUPERSEDED when draft completes
      - superseded_by_pick_id points to actual pick that replaced TBD
      - Transactions can migrate from TBD to actual picks automatically

      Lifecycle States:
      - ACTIVE_TBD: TBD pick currently in use (draft order not finalized)
      - SUPERSEDED: TBD pick replaced by actual pick (soft-delete)
      - ACTUAL: Pick from actual draft data (future state)
