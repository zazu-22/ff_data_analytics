# Trade Evaluation and Draft Pick Valuation

## Crowdsourced Valuation Systems

### KeepTradeCut (KTC) Methodology

**Core Mechanism:** Users rank three players of similar value, designating most valuable as "Keep," second as "Trade," least valuable as "Cut."

**Data Scale:**
- 23+ million data points (and counting)
- Rankings update in real-time with every user submission

**Quality Control:** Occasional "test" KTCs with obvious right answers to verify users are paying attention.

**Output:** Creates fluid, market-driven valuations rather than static rankings. More frequent "Keep" votes = higher ranking.

**Advantage:** Captures real-time market sentiment and league-wide consensus on player values.

**Use Cases:**
- Baseline for trade value comparison
- Identifying market inefficiencies (gap between KTC and your model)
- Gauging consensus value in trade negotiations

## Win-Win Trade Structures

### Identifying Complementary Needs

**Principle:** "The ideal trade candidate is with a team that is weak in a position that you may be strong in, so both teams can benefit from a trade."

**Targeting:** Seek teams that are heaviest where you're lightest—"these trades benefit everyone equally, regardless of overall roster construction."

### Even Swap Strategy

**Definition:** Send two players, get two players back.

**Benefit:** "Most of the time these trades benefit both teams by addressing both teams' specific needs." Made to help both teams' long-term goals, making them appealing.

### Account for Team Timelines

**Age Factor:**
- **Rebuilding:** Trade RBs for WRs—"wide receivers tend to hold their value longer in dynasty than running backs do"
- **Contending:** Target RBs by sending future-focused assets (picks, young WRs)

**Timeline Alignment:** Best trades align assets with competitive windows. Don't hold aging RBs while rebuilding; don't hold distant picks while contending.

### Quantity vs. Quality Premium

**2-for-1 or 3-for-2 Trades:** Side sending more players needs to overpay to smaller side.

**Example:** Trading for player with value of 75, sending 2 players? They likely need combined value of 98-113 (30-50% premium).

**Rationale:** Consolidating value into elite player requires premium because elite players are scarcer and provide competitive advantages.

**Strategic Use:**
- Contending teams pay premium to consolidate (need starting lineup upgrades)
- Rebuilding teams collect premium for breaking down elite assets (need depth/picks)

### Avoid Lopsided Offers

"Sending lopsided or nonsense trades that aren't helping both sides win, wastes time."

Shoot your shot, but understand league landscape and create mutually beneficial structures.

## Multi-Objective Optimization Considerations

**Dimension 1: Current Year Value**
- How much does this trade improve my starting lineup for this season?
- Measured by projected points added to weekly lineup

**Dimension 2: Future Value**
- How does this affect my team's outlook 1-3 years from now?
- Consider aging curves, contract situations, draft capital

**Dimension 3: Competitive Window Alignment**
- Does this trade align with my team's timeline (contending vs. rebuilding)?
- Don't waste competitive years; don't sacrifice future windows for marginal gains

**Dimension 4: Positional Scarcity**
- Am I trading for/away from a scarce position where replacement options are limited?
- Elite TEs and every-down RBs have premium due to scarcity

**Dimension 5: Market Timing**
- Is this player's value at peak (sell high) or trough (buy low)?
- Consider: injury status, recent performance, offseason hype cycles

**Balancing Act:** Successful dynasty trades rarely optimize just one dimension. Best trades create win-win scenarios where both sides improve along different dimensions aligned with their team situations.

## Manager Profiling

Understanding trade partners improves negotiation success:

**Risk Tolerance:**
- Some managers overvalue safety (proven veterans)
- Others chase upside (rookies/prospects)
- Match offers to their preferences

**Position Preferences:**
- Managers often overvalue certain positions or roster construction philosophies
- Identify: RB hoarders, Zero RB devotees, QB premium valuations

**Timeline Awareness:**
- Identify managers who don't recognize their competitive window
- Opportunities: Rebuilding team holding aging assets, contending team holding distant-future picks

**Trade Frequency:**
- Active traders vs. passive roster builders respond differently to offers
- Active traders more receptive to creative structures

**Market Knowledge:**
- Less engaged managers may not track player value changes
- Creates arbitrage opportunities (buy undervalued, sell overvalued assets)

## Draft Pick Valuation

### Value by Round

**First Round Picks:**
- Carry most value but not guaranteed "hits"
- Hit rate: ~45% become fantasy-relevant players
- Values often highest in weeks leading up to NFL Draft

**Second Round Picks:**
- Hit rates drop to 22%
- Miss rates skyrocket to 69%
- Still hold significant trade value due to upside potential

**Third Round and Later:**
- Much lower value with very low hit rates (<15%)
- Often referred to as "dart throws"
- Bundle multiple late picks to move up in value

### Valuation Methodologies

**Historical Averaging Method (DynastyProcess):**
- Pick value = average current valuation of best players from recent draft classes (2015-2018) at each pick position
- **Example:** 1.10 pick value = average of current 10th best players from 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 classes
- **Purpose:** Determines "absolute maximum a pick should be worth" by capturing owner optimism and upside framing

**Future Pick Discounting:**
- Future picks typically valued at 80% of current year equivalent
- Accounts for: time value, uncertainty, risk of pick moving (team performance changes)

### Strategic Timing Considerations

**Before NFL Draft:**
- Trading picks means giving up mystery and hype before it peaks
- Values often highest in weeks leading up to NFL Draft
- **Strategy:** Sell picks to contenders capitalizing on hype

**After NFL Draft:**
- Market typically cools as landing spots become known
- Hype consolidates around clear winners
- **Strategy:** Buy picks after draft if acquiring specific prospect

**During Season:**
- Pick values fluctuate based on team performance
- Early picks become more valuable as teams fall out of contention
- **Strategy:** Monitor standings, buy projected early picks from struggling teams mid-season

**NFL Draft Capital Consideration:**
- NFL teams using high picks indicates team faith and opportunity
- Prospects drafted high in NFL Draft warrant rise in dynasty rankings
- Landing spot matters: offensive scheme, surrounding talent, coaching

## Trade Evaluation Framework

**Step 1: Calculate Raw Value**
- Use crowdsourced tools (KTC, DynastyProcess) for baseline
- Apply quantity premium (30-50%) if consolidating/breaking apart assets

**Step 2: Assess Timeline Fit**
- Does trade align with competitive window?
- Am I trading future for now (contending) or now for future (rebuilding)?

**Step 3: Evaluate Positional Needs**
- Does trade address roster gaps?
- Am I creating new holes to fill old ones?

**Step 4: Consider Aging Curves**
- Are acquired players entering prime or decline?
- See aging_curves.md for position-specific patterns

**Step 5: Market Timing**
- Is this buying low or selling high?
- Player value trajectory: rising, stable, or declining?

**Final Check:** Does this trade make both teams better along dimensions that matter to their specific situations? If not, revise or walk away.
