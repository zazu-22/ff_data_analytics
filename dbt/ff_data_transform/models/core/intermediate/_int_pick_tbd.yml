      TBD (To Be Determined) picks extraction from transactions.

      Grain: One row per TBD pick referenced in transactions
      Source: stg_sheets__transactions (pick_id references with '_TBD' suffix)

      Extracts future-year picks traded before draft order is finalized. These picks
      have unknown slot numbers until the regular season ends and standings are set.

      Format: YYYY_R#_TBD (e.g., "2027_R1_TBD")

      Example Timeline:
      - 2025: Team trades "2027 1st round pick" → pick_id: 2027_R1_TBD
      - 2026 season ends: Team finishes 5th place
      - 2027 rookie draft: pick_id becomes 2027_R1_P05

      Note: Slot number and overall pick use placeholder value (99) until finalized.
