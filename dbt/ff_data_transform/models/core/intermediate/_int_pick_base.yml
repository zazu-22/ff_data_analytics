      Base draft picks generator - P01 through P12 for all years and rounds.

      Grain: One row per base pick (12 picks × 5 rounds × 19 years = 1,140 picks)
      Source: Standalone generator (no dependencies)

      Generates the "natural" 12-team draft structure without compensatory picks.
      These are the picks determined by final standings and playoff results.

      Coverage:
      - Years: 2012-2030 (19 years)
      - Rounds: 1-5 (all generated; historical 4-round years filtered downstream)
      - Slots: P01-P12 (12 teams)

      Note: overall_pick is provisional and recalculated in final model to account
      for compensatory picks in prior rounds.
