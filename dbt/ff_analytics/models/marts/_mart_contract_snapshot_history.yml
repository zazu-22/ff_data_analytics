      Contract snapshot mart - historical point-in-time contract obligations (commissioner sheet snapshots).

      **Grain**: One row per player per franchise per snapshot date per obligation year
      **Source**: stg_sheets__contracts_active (direct from commissioner's CONTRACTS_ACTIVE sheet)

      Provides point-in-time historical view of contract obligations as recorded in the
      commissioner's CONTRACTS_ACTIVE sheet at various snapshot dates.

      **Key Differences from mart_contract_snapshot_current**:
      - Uses direct commissioner sheet snapshots (not derived from transaction log)
      - Includes snapshot_date as grain component (enables time-series)
      - Shows obligations as commissioner recorded them at each point in time
      - May include manual corrections not yet in transaction log

      **Use Cases**:
      - Historical cap space: Obligations as of specific past dates
      - Validation: Compare transaction-derived vs commissioner snapshots
      - Trend analysis: Evolution of obligations over time
      - Commissioner audit: Track changes between snapshot dates
