      Actual rookie draft picks extracted from commissioner transactions.

      Grain: One row per draft pick (base + compensatory) per season
      Source: stg_sheets__transactions (rookie_draft_selection transactions)

      from rookie_draft_selection transactions. This becomes the source of truth for
      base picks once a draft is complete and enables TBD→actual lifecycle transitions.

      - transaction_id: Draft event identifier
      - round / pick_number: From commissioner sheet
      - to_franchise_*: Identifies drafting franchise
      - player_*: Drafted player metadata

      Outputs canonical pick_id (YYYY_R#_P##) with proper sequencing.
