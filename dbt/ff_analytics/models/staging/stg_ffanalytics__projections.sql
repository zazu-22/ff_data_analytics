/*
Stage FFanalytics weighted consensus projections.

Source: data/raw/ffanalytics/projections/ (consensus output from R runner)
Output grain: one row per player per stat per projection horizon per as-of date
Crosswalk: player name â†’ mfl_id via dim_player_id_xref (already done in R runner)

Key transformations:
- Real-world stats only (measure_domain='real_world')
- Normalize horizon values ('weekly', 'full_season', 'rest_of_season')
- Map to canonical stat names for consistency with actuals
- Filter out unmapped players (player_id = -1) for now

NOTE: Player mapping happens in R runner, not here. R runner outputs player_id already.
