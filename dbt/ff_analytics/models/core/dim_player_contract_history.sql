/*
Player contract history dimension - clean contract state over time.

Grain: One row per player per contract period per franchise
Source: fact_league_transactions (contract-creating events)
Architecture: Type 2 SCD dimension

This dimension derives clean contract state from the transaction event log,
enabling dead cap calculations, roster timeline reconstruction, and salary
cap analysis.

Key Design Decisions:
- Type 2 SCD with effective_date/expiration_date for contract validity
- Contract lifecycle: signed → [extended/restructured] → terminated
- Dead cap calculated using dim_cut_liability_schedule
- Rookie contracts identified and linked to dim_rookie_contract_scale
- Annual amounts calculated for cap roll-ups

Contract Lifecycle Events:
- Created by: rookie_draft_selection, faad, fasa
- Modified by: extension, restructure
- Transferred by: trade (to new franchise, contract continues)
- Terminated by: cut, trade away, expiration

Grain Example Rows:
player_id=12345, franchise_id=F001, contract_period=1 → Rookie contract 2020-2024
player_id=12345, franchise_id=F005, contract_period=2 → Trade-acquired 2024-2025
player_id=12345, franchise_id=F001, contract_period=3 → Re-signed FAAD 2025-2027

Type 2 SCD Fields:
- effective_date: When this contract state became active
- expiration_date: When it ended (9999-12-31 if still active)
- is_current: True if contract is currently active
