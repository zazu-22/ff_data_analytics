## Section 1: Player Valuation Frameworks

### 1.1 Value Over Replacement (VoR)

**Definition:** The fantasy points a player provides above a freely available replacement player.

**Formula:**

```
VoR = Player_Projected_Points - Replacement_Level_Points
```

**Replacement Level Baselines:**

| Method            | Definition                              | Dynasty Application         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Worst Starter** | Last starter in typical lineup          | RB24, WR36, QB12 in 12-team |
| **Man-Games**     | Average starter accounting for injuries | 75% of worst starter        |
| **Draft Round**   | Last player drafted in that position    | Round-specific baseline     |

**Multi-Year Dynasty VoR:**

```
Dynasty_VoR = Σ(VoR_year_i / (1 + discount_rate)^i) for i=1 to n

Where:
- discount_rate varies by position (RB: 15-20%, WR: 8-12%, QB: 5-8%)
- n = years of projected production (typically 3-5)
```

**Concrete Example:**

```
Jonathan Taylor (Age 24 RB):
- Year 1: 250 pts - 125 baseline = 125 VoR
- Year 2: 240 pts - 125 baseline = 115 VoR (discounted @ 15% = 100.0)
- Year 3: 220 pts - 125 baseline = 95 VoR (discounted @ 15% = 71.8)
- Dynasty VoR = 125 + 100.0 + 71.8 = 296.8

vs. Derrick Henry (Age 29 RB):
- Year 1: 260 pts - 125 baseline = 135 VoR
- Year 2: 200 pts - 125 baseline = 75 VoR (discounted @ 20% = 62.5)
- Year 3: 150 pts - 125 baseline = 25 VoR (discounted @ 20% = 17.4)
- Dynasty VoR = 135 + 62.5 + 17.4 = 214.9

Taylor has 38% higher dynasty value despite Henry's superior Year 1 projection.

______________________________________________________________________

### 1.2 Value-Based Drafting (VBD)

**Definition:** Cross-positional ranking system that accounts for replacement level and positional scarcity.

**7-Step Process:**

1. Project all players
2. Convert to fantasy points
3. Determine replacement level baseline (VBD/VORP/BEER)
4. Calculate X-values (points above baseline)
5. Apply position multipliers for scarcity
6. Create unified rankings
7. Adjust for roster needs

**X-Value Formula:**

```
X_value = (Player_Points - Baseline_Points) × Position_Multiplier

Position Multipliers (12-team PPR example):
- RB: 1.5 (highest scarcity)
- WR: 1.0 (baseline)
- QB: 0.5 (1QB format, low scarcity)
- TE: 1.2 (moderate scarcity)

Superflex adjustments:
- QB: 2.0 (extreme scarcity)
- Other positions: unchanged
```

**Baseline Variants:**

| Method    | Formula                 | Best For                |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **VOLS**  | Worst starter           | Redraft leagues         |
| **VORP**  | Average replacement     | Deep benches            |
| **BEER**  | Expected bench points   | Shallow benches         |
| **BEER+** | Position-adjusted bench | Recommended for dynasty |

**Concrete Example:**

```
Christian McCaffrey (RB):
- Projected: 280 pts
- Baseline (RB24): 150 pts
- X-value: (280 - 150) × 1.5 = 195

Justin Jefferson (WR):
- Projected: 300 pts (more than CMC!)
- Baseline (WR36): 140 pts
- X-value: (300 - 140) × 1.0 = 160

Result: CMC ranks higher (195 vs 160) despite fewer raw points due to RB scarcity.

### 1.3 Wins Above Replacement (WAR)

**Definition:** Converts fantasy points to expected wins using probability distributions, accounting for consistency.

**Methodology:**

```
Win_Probability = P(Your_Score > Opponent_Score)

Where opponent score is modeled as normal distribution:
- Mean: League average weekly score
- StdDev: League score volatility

WAR = (Win_Prob_with_Player - Win_Prob_with_Replacement) × Games_Played
```

**Key Insight:** Consistency matters - low variance players have higher WAR than volatile players with equal means.

**Concrete Example:**

```
Cooper Kupp (2021):
- Average: 21.6 PPG
- StdDev: 5.2 (very consistent)
- Baseline WR: 12.4 PPG, StdDev: 8.1
- Win probability with Kupp: 72%
- Win probability with replacement: 50%
- WAR: (0.72 - 0.50) × 17 games = +3.74 wins

Tyreek Hill (2021):
- Average: 21.6 PPG (same as Kupp!)
- StdDev: 11.3 (boom/bust)
- Win probability: 68% (lower due to variance)
- WAR: (0.68 - 0.50) × 17 = +3.06 wins

Kupp > Hill despite identical averages due to consistency advantage.
```

### 1.4 Model vs. Market Pricing

**Framework:** Compare model-based valuations (projections + aging curves) against market prices (ADP, KTC values) to identify inefficiencies.

**Gap Formula:**

```
Value_Gap_% = (Model_Value - Market_Value) / Market_Value × 100

Trading Signals:
- Gap > +25% = STRONG BUY (market undervalues)
- Gap +10% to +25% = BUY (modest edge)
- Gap -10% to +10% = HOLD (efficient pricing)
- Gap -10% to -25% = SELL (modest overvalue)
- Gap < -25% = STRONG SELL (market overvalues)
```

2. **ADP Consensus**

   - Average draft position across platforms
   - FFPC, Underdog, Sleeper, MFL
   - Format-specific (1QB vs Superflex)

**Concrete Example:**

```
CeeDee Lamb (Age 24 WR):
- Model value: 8,500 (based on 3-year discounted projections)
- Market value (KTC): 7,200
- Gap: (8,500 - 7,200) / 7,200 = +18.1%
- Signal: BUY - Market undervalues long-term upside

James Cook (Age 24 RB):
- Model value: 4,800 (limited college dominator, timeshare risk)
- Market value (KTC): 6,500
- Gap: (4,800 - 6,500) / 6,500 = -26.2%
- Signal: STRONG SELL - Market overvalues due to 2023 TD spike (TDOE +4.8)

### 1.5 Sustainable vs. Fluky Performance

**Framework:** Distinguish signal (sustainable production) from noise (luck-driven outliers) using metric stability.

**Touchdown Regression Research:**

| TDOE Category           | Sample        | Next Year TD Change   | Source              |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Positive (+3.0 or more) | 25 WR seasons | -52% average decline  | Fantasy Footballers |
| Negative (-3.0 or less) | 24 WR seasons | +93% average increase | Fantasy Footballers |

**Formula:**

```
TDOE (TD Over Expected) = Actual_TDs - Expected_TDs

Where Expected_TDs = (Target_Share × Team_Pass_TDs × 0.8) + (Rush_Attempts / Team_Rush_Attempts × Team_Rush_TDs)

Regression Rule:
- If TDOE > +3.0: Expect 50%+ TD decline next year (SELL signal)
- If TDOE < -3.0: Expect 90%+ TD increase next year (BUY signal)
```

**Sticky vs. Fluky Metrics:**

| Metric                       | Year-to-Year r² | Classification    | Trading Implication       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Targets**                  | 0.65            | Sticky            | Trust for projections     |
| **Target Share**             | 0.60            | Sticky            | Opportunity > efficiency  |
| **TPRR** (Targets per route) | 0.65            | Sticky            | Best WR predictive metric |
| **YPRR** (Yards per route)   | 0.58            | Moderately sticky | Reliable efficiency       |
| **Touchdowns**               | 0.30            | Fluky             | Regress to mean           |
| **TD Rate**                  | 0.25            | Fluky             | Luck-driven outliers      |
| **YAC**                      | 0.40            | Moderately fluky  | Context-dependent         |

**Opportunity vs. Efficiency:**

```
Sustainable Production = High Opportunity × Average Efficiency
Fluky Production = Low Opportunity × Elite Efficiency

Buy Profile (Sustainable):
- Target share > 22%
- TPRR > 0.20
- Air yards share > 25%
- TD rate 8-12% (within normal range)

Sell Profile (Fluky):
- Target share < 18%
- TPRR < 0.15
- TD rate > 16% (likely to regress)
- YAC heavily scheme/situation dependent
```

**Concrete Example:**

```
Amon-Ra St. Brown (2023):
- Target share: 28.4% (elite, sticky)
- TPRR: 0.26 (excellent)
- TDs: 10 on 119 targets = 8.4% rate (sustainable)
- TDOE: +0.3 (minimal regression risk)
- Verdict: HOLD/BUY - Production is sustainable

Rashid Shaheed (2023):
- Target share: 13.1% (low, role uncertainty)
- TPRR: 0.17 (below average)
- TDs: 6 on 46 targets = 13.0% rate (unsustainable)
- TDOE: +3.2 (extreme positive outlier)
- Verdict: SELL - High TD rate unlikely to repeat, limited opportunity

Thresholds:
- Elite (WR1 potential): > 0.70
- Good (WR2 potential): 0.55 - 0.70
- Average (WR3/Flex): 0.40 - 0.55
- Concerning: < 0.40

Most predictive statistic for evaluating WR value (r² = 0.72)
```

**YPRR (Yards Per Route Run):**

```
YPRR = Receiving_Yards / Routes_Run

Thresholds:
- Elite: > 2.5
- Good: 2.0 - 2.5
- Average: 1.5 - 2.0
- Poor: < 1.2

Year-to-year correlation: r² = 0.58 (moderately sticky)
Best single efficiency metric for WRs
```

**TPRR (Targets Per Route Run):**

```
TPRR = Targets / Routes_Run

Thresholds:
- Elite: > 0.25
- Good: 0.20 - 0.25
- Average: 0.15 - 0.20
- Poor: < 0.15

Year-to-year correlation: r² = 0.65 (very sticky)
"Most reliable and predictive" per PlayerProfiler
```

**Opportunity Share (RBs):**

```
Opportunity_Share = (Carries + Targets) / Team_Total_RB_Opportunities

Thresholds:
- Workhorse (RB1): > 60%
- Committee lead (RB2): 45-60%
- Split back (Flex): 30-45%
- Change of pace: < 30%

Elite RB indicator: Opp Share > 55% + TPRR > 0.10

## Section 2: Aging Curves & Positional Value

### 2.1 Running Backs: The Cliff

**Peak Ages:** 23-26 (76% of elite seasons occur in this range)

**Aging Pattern:**

```
Age Range | Performance vs. Peak | Trading Recommendation
----------|---------------------|------------------------
22-23     | 95% (ascending)     | BUY - entering peak
24-26     | 100% (peak)         | HOLD - maximize value
27-28     | 75% (sharp decline) | SELL - before cliff
29+       | 50% (steep drop)    | AVOID - fragile assets
```

**Key Research Findings:**

1. **The Age 27-28 Cliff:** 25.2% average decline in production

   - Source: PFF Aging Curves Study

2. **Career Length:** Only 2.57 seasons average (shortest of any position)

   - High injury rates and physical demands

3. **Elite Season Concentration:** 76% occur ages 23-26, only 10% after age 28

4. **Dynasty Rule of 26:** Sell RBs before age 27, avoid acquiring RBs age 28+

**Concrete Examples:**

```
Christian McCaffrey:
- Age 26 (2022): RB3 overall, 289.5 PPR pts
- Age 27 (2023): RB1 overall, 352.4 PPR pts (outlier season)
- Historical pattern: 90% of RBs decline by age 27
- Action: Peak selling window NOW despite career year

Derrick Henry:
- Age 26 (2020): RB1, 388.0 pts (career peak)
- Age 27 (2021): RB15, 213.2 pts (-45% decline!)
- Age 28 (2022): RB11, 242.4 pts (partial recovery)
- Age 29 (2023): RB18, 203.8 pts (continued decline)
- Pattern matches research: steep post-27 decline
```

**Trading Heuristics:**

- Buy window: Ages 22-25
- Hold window: Ages 23-27 (if contending)
- Sell window: Ages 26-27 (before cliff)
- Avoid window: Ages 28+ (unless championship push)

### 2.2 Wide Receivers: Blue Chip Stocks

**Peak Ages:** 26-30 (broad, stable window)

**Aging Pattern:**

```
Age Range | Performance vs. Peak | Trading Recommendation
----------|---------------------|------------------------
22-24     | 85% (developing)    | BUY - pre-peak value
25-27     | 100% (peak)         | HOLD - prime years
28-30     | 95% (slight decline)| HOLD - still elite
31-33     | 80% (gradual drop)  | SELL (rebuilders)
34+       | 60% (steep decline) | AVOID - exception: HOF
```

**Key Research Findings:**

1. **Gradual Decline:** WRs maintain 92% of production through age 34

   - Source: Dynasty League Football study

2. **Career Length:** 7-10 year careers common (longest position)

   - Lower injury rates than RBs
   - Skills-based position ages better

3. **Alternative "Mortality Table" Model:**

   - Some WRs see sudden cliff (injury, lost role)
   - Others sustain elite production to age 35+
   - Bimodal distribution (not smooth curve)
   - Source: Adam Harstad, Footballguys

4. **Breakout Age Matters:**

   - Breakout by age 23: 65% chance of WR1 season
   - Breakout after age 25: 20% chance of WR1 season

**Concrete Examples:**

```
Davante Adams:
- Age 27 (2020): WR1, 327.2 PPR pts
- Age 28 (2021): WR2, 301.5 PPR pts
- Age 29 (2022): WR5, 272.3 PPR pts (new team)
- Age 30 (2023): WR5, 272.9 PPR pts
- Pattern: Sustained WR1 production into age 30

Tyreek Hill:
- Age 27 (2021): WR3, 302.8 PPR pts
- Age 28 (2022): WR1, 349.4 PPR pts (career high!)
- Age 29 (2023): WR2, 307.6 PPR pts
- Pattern: Peak extended through age 29

DeAndre Hopkins:
- Age 28 (2020): WR3, 285.4 PPR pts
- Age 29 (2021): WR45, 96.9 PPR pts (injury)
- Age 30 (2022): WR25, 184.2 PPR pts
- Age 31 (2023): WR27, 190.5 PPR pts
- Pattern: Injury cliff, not gradual aging
```

**Trading Heuristics:**

- Buy window: Ages 24-28 (prime acquisition targets)
- Hold window: Ages 25-30 (foundation pieces)
- Sell window: Ages 30-31 (rebuilders), 33+ (all teams)
- Avoid window: Ages 34+ (exception: Julio-type HOF talents)

**Dynasty Strategy:** "WRs are king" - prioritize WR draft picks, longest value retention

### 2.3 Quarterbacks: Marathon Runners

**Peak Ages:** 28-33 (longest peak window)

**Aging Pattern:**

```
Age Range | Performance vs. Peak | Trading Recommendation
----------|---------------------|------------------------
22-24     | 75% (learning)      | BUY (Superflex) - upside
25-27     | 95% (ascending)     | BUY - entering peak
28-33     | 100% (peak)         | HOLD - prime years
34-36     | 90% (slight decline)| HOLD (contenders) / SELL (rebuild)
37+       | 70% (variable)      | SELL - exception: Brady-types
```

**Key Research Findings:**

1. **Extended Careers:** Average 4.44 seasons (2nd longest to WRs)

   - Low-contact position
   - Mental game improves with experience
   - Can maintain elite production into late 30s

2. **Mobile QB Cliff:** 25.7% decline in rushing yards at age 27

   - Source: PFF Mobile QB Aging Study
   - Affects Lamar Jackson, Josh Allen, Justin Fields archetypes

3. **Superflex Value Premium:** QB worth 2-3x more in Superflex vs. 1QB

   - 75% of NFL starting QBs rostered in 12-team Superflex
   - Scarcity creates extreme value

4. **Rookie Learning Curve:** Only 35% of rookie QBs finish as QB1 (top 12)

   - Year 2-3 typical breakout window

**Concrete Examples:**

```
Patrick Mahomes:
- Age 25 (2020): QB2, 421.4 pts
- Age 27 (2022): QB1, 434.8 pts
- Age 28 (2023): QB5, 376.0 pts
- Pattern: Sustained elite production, entering decade of peak

Tom Brady (historical):
- Age 40 (2017): QB6, 351.2 pts
- Age 43 (2020): QB5, 399.3 pts
- Pattern: Outlier longevity to age 45

Josh Allen (mobile QB):
- Age 24 (2020): QB1, 460.8 pts (rushing: 421 yds, 8 TDs)
- Age 25 (2021): QB5, 389.4 pts (rushing: 763 yds, 6 TDs)
- Age 26 (2022): QB3, 415.0 pts (rushing: 762 yds, 7 TDs)
- Age 27 (2023): QB7, 360.7 pts (rushing: 524 yds, 15 TDs)
- Pattern: Rushing decline, TD spike (may regress)
```

**Trading Heuristics (Superflex):**

- Buy window: Ages 23-28 (secure QB1 for decade)
- Hold window: Ages 25-34 (prime asset)
- Sell window: Ages 35+ (rebuilders), 38+ (all teams)
- Avoid window: Ages 39+ (exception: proven elite with mobility)

**Trading Heuristics (1QB):**

- Stream/punt: QBs have low relative value
- Don't draft early: Wait until QB12-15 range
- Target: Ages 25-32 (value + prime overlap)

### 2.4 Tight Ends: Late Bloomers

**Peak Ages:** 25-27 (40.9% of elite seasons)

**Aging Pattern:**

```
Age Range | Performance vs. Peak | Trading Recommendation
----------|---------------------|------------------------
21-23     | 40% (learning)      | HOLD (taxi) - rarely produce
24        | 85% (sophomore jump)| BUY - breakout window
25-27     | 100% (peak)         | HOLD - prime years
28-30     | 90% (slight decline)| HOLD (contenders)
31+       | 65% (sharp decline) | SELL - steep drop
```

**Key Research Findings:**

1. **Sophomore Surge:** +98.5% PPR PPG increase from Year 1 to Year 2

   - Source: Footballguys TE Breakout Study
   - Most TEs are "taxi squad" candidates as rookies

2. **Sharp Age 31+ Decline:** 91.8% of peak seasons occur before age 33

3. **Elite Concentration:** Only 3-5 "elite" TEs in any given season

   - Massive scarcity premium
   - TE3-12 cluster tightly (low differentiation)

4. **Position Devaluation:** Dynasty managers often underprice TEs

   - Buy-low opportunity on proven elite TEs
   - Avoid overpaying for "next Kelce" rookies

**Concrete Examples:**

```
Travis Kelce:
- Age 27 (2017): TE1, 215.6 PPR pts
- Age 31 (2021): TE1, 270.2 PPR pts (career high!)
- Age 33 (2023): TE1, 254.5 PPR pts
- Pattern: Outlier sustained elite production past 30

Mark Andrews:
- Age 23 (2019): TE7, 155.9 pts (breakout)
- Age 24 (2020): TE6, 169.3 pts
- Age 25 (2021): TE1, 245.0 pts (peak)
- Age 26 (2022): TE4, 162.3 pts
- Pattern: Peak at 25, some volatility

T.J. Hockenson:
- Age 22 (Rookie, 2019): TE20, 88.8 pts
- Age 23 (2020): TE13, 121.7 pts (+37% sophomore surge)
- Age 24 (2021): TE7, 171.0 pts
- Age 25 (2022): TE4, 182.3 pts
- Pattern: Classic gradual ascent to peak ages 24-25
```

**Trading Heuristics:**

- Avoid: Rookie TEs (rarely produce Year 1)
- Buy window: Ages 24-26 (post-breakout, pre-peak value)
- Hold window: Ages 25-29 (prime years)
- Sell window: Ages 30-31 (decline imminent)

**Dynasty Strategy:**

- Taxi squad rookies (don't waste roster spots Year 1)
- Target Year 2-3 TEs in drafts (best value window)
- Pay up for elite (Kelce/Andrews tier) - massive edge
- Avoid overpaying for "hype" rookie TEs

### 2.5 Positional Value & Scarcity

**Value Over Replacement (VoR) by Position:**

| Position     | Top-End VoR | Replacement Level | Scarcity Rating           |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| **RB**       | 150-200     | RB24 (~125 pts)   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Extreme        |
| **WR**       | 120-160     | WR36 (~140 pts)   | ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate           |
| **TE**       | 100-140     | TE12 (~6.3 PPG)   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High (top-heavy) |
| **QB (1QB)** | 80-120      | QB12 (~280 pts)   | ⭐ Low                    |
| **QB (SF)**  | 180-250     | QB24 (~220 pts)   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Extreme        |

**League Format Impact on Positional Value:**

```
Standard 1QB PPR (12-team):
1. WR (foundation position, long careers)
2. RB (high scarcity, win-now value)
3. TE (elite tier massive edge)
4. QB (streamable, low priority)

Superflex/2QB PPR (12-team):
1. QB (extreme scarcity, 75% rostered)
2. WR (long careers, stable value)
3. RB (still important but secondary)
4. TE (unchanged relative importance)

TE Premium (1.5 PPR for TEs):
- Elite TEs (Kelce tier) gain ~30% value
- Only 1 WR outscored Mark Andrews in 2021 with 1.5 TEP
- Increases TE draft priority by ~2 rounds
```

**Positional Allocation Strategy:**

| Team State           | RB% | WR% | QB% | TE% |
| -------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Contending (1QB)** | 35% | 40% | 10% | 15% |
| **Rebuilding (1QB)** | 20% | 55% | 10% | 15% |
| **Contending (SF)**  | 25% | 35% | 30% | 10% |
| **Rebuilding (SF)**  | 15% | 45% | 30% | 10% |

**Rationale:**

- **Contenders:** Load RBs (win-now), accept shortened shelf life
- **Rebuilders:** Prioritize WRs (long careers) and QBs (SF value), defer RBs (will age out)

## Section 3: Strategic Frameworks

### 3.1 Team State Assessment

**The Competitive Lifecycle Framework:**

```
                    PROJECTED RECORD
                         ↓
        ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐
        ↓                ↓                ↓
   TOP 4 FINISH    MIDDLE (5-8)    BOTTOM 4 FINISH
        ↓                ↓                ↓
   CONTENDING        PURGATORY         REBUILDING
        ↓                ↓                ↓
Trade picks      CHOOSE NOW!        Accumulate picks
for players      (Don't stay stuck)   & young players
```

**State Definitions:**

**CONTENDING:**

- Criteria: Projected top-4 finish OR 2+ top-10 players OR 4+ top-25 players
- Strategy: Trade future picks for proven starters ages 24-28
- Timeline: 2-3 year window
- Position focus: RBs (maximize win-now), proven WRs, elite TEs

**PURGATORY (AVOID!):**

- Criteria: Projected 5th-8th place finish
- Problem: "Absolute worst spot in dynasty" - neither competing nor building
- Solution: Make decisive commitment by Week 4-6 (don't wait!)
- Decision tree:
  - Have young elite pieces (3+ players age 24)? → Retool (selective sells)
  - Aging core (3+ players age 28+)? → Hard rebuild (full teardown)

**REBUILDING:**

- Criteria: Projected 9th-12th finish OR aging core (5+ players age 27+)
- Strategy: "The Productive Struggle" - intentional tanking
- Timeline: Target years 3-4 for competitive window
- Position focus: WRs & QBs (long careers), young TEs (sophomore surge)

**Quick Assessment Heuristics:**

| Metric                          | Contender | Purgatory | Rebuilder |
| ------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| **Projected finish**            | 1-4       | 5-8       | 9-12      |
| **Top-10 players**              | 2+        | 1         | 0         |
| **Top-25 players**              | 4+        | 2-3       | 0-1       |
| **Average age (starters)**      | 26        | 27        | 28+ or 23 |
| **1st round picks (next 2yrs)** | 1-2       | 2-3       | 4-6       |

### 3.2 The Productive Struggle (Rebuild Strategy)

**Timeline:**

```
YEAR 1: Full Teardown
├─ Sell ALL veterans (RBs age 26+, WRs age 29+, aging QBs)
├─ Target: 4-6 future 1st round picks
├─ Accept losses (goal: last place for 1.01)
└─ Draft BPA regardless of position

YEAR 2: Develop & Draft
├─ Use picks on high-upside rookies (WRs, QBs priority)
├─ Start young players (tank for another top pick)
├─ DO NOT compete yet (resist temptation!)
└─ Accumulate 2-3 more future 1sts

YEAR 3: Begin Competitive Window
├─ Young core now ages 23-25 (entering production)
├─ Selectively add veterans for holes
├─ Target: playoffs (don't need to win yet)
└─ RBs now viable (won't age out during window)

YEAR 4: Championship Push
├─ Core in peak years
├─ All-in trades for missing pieces
├─ Load RBs for maximum win-now
└─ Execute championship run
```

**Key Principles:**

1. **Commit Fully:** Half-measures fail - sell EVERYONE valuable

   - Holding aging RBs "just in case" torpedoes rebuild

2. **Young WR Foundation:** "WRs are king" in rebuilds

   - 7-10 year careers provide stable value through window
   - Target ages 22-24, especially Year 2-3 breakout candidates

3. **Defer RB Investments:** RBs acquired in Year 1-2 will age out

   - Wait until Year 3 to load RBs
   - 3-5 year careers mean Year 3 RBs expire Year 7 (perfect timing)

4. **Resist Year 2 Temptation:** "The real target is the third and fourth seasons"

   - Rookies start slow, improve Year 2-3
   - Competing Year 2 wastes assets, extends rebuild to Year 5+

5. **Draft BPA, Not Need:** Accumulate best young assets

   - Can always trade for specific needs later
   - Quality > position balance early

**Common Rebuild Mistakes:**

| Mistake                   | Why It Fails             | Correct Approach             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Holding aging RBs         | Age out before window    | Sell all RBs 26+ immediately |
| Incomplete teardown       | Stuck in purgatory       | Commit to full rebuild       |
| Year 2 playoff push       | Extends rebuild timeline | Stay bad Years 1-2           |
| Targeting only 2025 picks | Rookies slow Year 1      | Mix 2025/2026/2027 picks     |
| Overvaluing own players   | Attachment bias          | Trade based on market value  |
| Drafting for need         | Reaches, weak assets     | Always BPA (trade later)     |

**Concrete Example:**

```
YEAR 1 TEARDOWN (2023):
- Sell Derrick Henry (age 29) → 2024 1st + 2025 2nd
- Sell Keenan Allen (age 31) → 2024 1st
- Sell Tyler Lockett (age 31) → 2025 2nd
- Sell Evan Engram (age 29) → 2024 3rd
- Result: Finish 12th, acquire 1.01 pick

Picks accumulated: Three 2024 1sts, 1.01, two 2025 1sts

YEAR 2 DEVELOP (2024):
- Draft Marvin Harrison Jr. (1.01)
- Draft Brock Bowers (1.04 - own pick)
- Draft Keon Coleman (1.08 - traded up)
- Draft Jaylen Wright RB (2.03)
- Start rookies, finish 11th (acquire 1.02)

Young Core (entering Year 3): MHJ (23), Bowers (23), Coleman (22), Wright (22)

YEAR 3 COMPETE (2025):
- Core now productive (Year 2-3 breakout window)
- Add proven RB (trade 2026 1st for 25yo Breece Hall)
- Add veteran WR (trade 2026 2nd for 27yo DeVonta Smith)
- Target: Playoffs (50% chance)

YEAR 4 CHAMPIONSHIP (2026):
- Core in prime (ages 24-26)
- All-in: Trade 2027 1st + 2nd for age 25 Travis Etienne
- Result: Stacked roster in peak window

### 3.3 Win-Now Strategy (Contender Playbook)

**Philosophy:** "The goal is to win championships, not accumulate assets."

**Strategic Pillars:**

1. **Maximize Current Roster Strength**

   - Start best players regardless of age
   - Trade future picks for immediate upgrades
   - Accept shortened competitive window

2. **Position-Specific Strategies:**

   - **RB:** Load 3-4 RBs ages 24-27 (prime window)
   - **WR:** Balance proven (ages 26-29) with emerging (ages 24-25)
   - **QB (SF):** Lock in 2 QBs ages 25-32
   - **TE:** Secure one elite (top-5) TE

3. **Asset Liquidation:**

   - Trade future 1sts for proven starters (value 1st ≈ pick 5-8 player)
   - Trade young prospects for vets (swap 22yo WR for 27yo WR upgrade)
   - Accept negative long-term value for positive short-term value

**Trading Framework:**

```
ALWAYS BUY:
├─ RBs ages 24-27 (peak window, 2-3 years left)
├─ WRs ages 26-29 (prime production, 3-5 years left)
├─ Proven QBs ages 25-32 (Superflex)
└─ Elite TEs ages 25-28 (scarcity premium)

SELL IMMEDIATELY:
├─ All future 1st/2nd round picks (convert to players)
├─ Young WRs age ≤23 without path to starting (upside years wasted)
├─ RBs age ≤22 (won't produce this year, limited future years)
└─ Speculative TEs (stream/waiver instead)

CONDITIONAL:
├─ Aging vets (RBs 28+, WRs 30+): Only if elite AND filling specific need
└─ Injured stars: Only if timeline for return < 6 weeks
```

**Trade Value Adjustments (Contender Lens):**

| Asset Type           | Market Value | Contender Value | Multiplier            |
| -------------------- | ------------ | --------------- | --------------------- |
| 2025 mid-1st         | 100%         | 120%            | 1.2x (need NOW)       |
| 2026 early-1st       | 100%         | 70%             | 0.7x (too far out)    |
| Age 27 RB (elite)    | 100%         | 140%            | 1.4x (perfect window) |
| Age 24 WR (emerging) | 100%         | 85%             | 0.85x (prefer proven) |
| Age 31 WR (elite)    | 100%         | 110%            | 1.1x (productive now) |

**The "All-In" Trade Package:**

```
Situation: You're projected 1st, have elite QB/WR core, need RB upgrade

PACKAGE OFFER:
Give: 2025 1st (mid) + 2026 1st + 2026 2nd + Age 23 WR prospect
Get: Age 26 Breece Hall (RB6 overall)

Analysis:
- Market value: Slight overpay (~115% value)
- Contender value: Even/slight win (~98% value)
- Justification: Missing piece for championship, window is NOW
- Risk: If you DON'T win, teardown becomes harder (fewer picks)
- Decision: ACCEPT - championship equity > draft picks
```

**Championship Push Checklist:**

- [ ] 2+ top-12 players at my most valuable position (RB in 1QB, QB in SF)
- [ ] Zero significant holes in starting lineup (no streaming positions)
- [ ] Depth: 2+ startable backups per position (injury insurance)
- [ ] Schedule: Favorable playoff schedule (check opponent strength weeks 15-17)
- [ ] Picks liquidated: 0-1 future 1sts remaining (converted to players)
- [ ] Age profile: Core players ages 24-28 (peak window alignment)

**Common Contender Mistakes:**

1. **Holding Future Picks:** "I might need them later" - No! Convert NOW.
2. **Undervaluing Aging Elites:** "He's 30" - Production > age for contenders.
3. **Overvaluing Young Prospects:** "He might break out" - Might ≠ will.
4. **Ignoring Depth:** "My starters are great" - Injuries happen, need 2-deep.
5. **Half-Committing:** "I'll keep some picks" - Go all-in or don't compete.

### 3.4 Draft Capital & Rookie Valuation

**NFL Draft Capital Correlation:**

| Draft Round     | RB Hit Rate | WR Hit Rate | TE Hit Rate | QB Hit Rate |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **1st Round**   | 78.57%      | 52.4%       | 55.6%       | 61.5%       |
| **2nd Round**   | 46.5%       | 28.6%       | 25.0%       | 30.0%       |
| **3rd Round**   | 31.3%       | 22.2%       | 18.2%       | 22.2%       |
| **Day 3 (4-7)** | 14.1%       | 12.5%       | 8.3%        | 10.0%       |

**Key Finding:** "NFL draft position is the single best quantifiable predictor of fantasy success."

**Production Gap:**

- 1st round RBs score 34% more PPR points than Day 2 RBs
- 1st round WRs score 28% more PPR points than Day 2 WRs

**Dynasty Rookie Draft Strategy:**

```
EARLY PICKS (1.01-1.04):
├─ Target: 1st round NFL RBs (78% hit rate)
├─ OR: Elite prospect WRs (1st round + dominator + breakout age)
└─ Avoid: QBs (unless Superflex), TEs (rarely produce Year 1)

MID PICKS (1.05-1.12):
├─ Target: 1st/2nd round WRs with target opportunity
├─ OR: Day 2 RBs with clear path to touches (fragile picks)
└─ Conditional: QBs in Superflex with starting job

LATE PICKS (2.01-3.12):
├─ Strategy: High-variance upside swings (lottery tickets)
├─ Target: Day 3 players with exceptional metrics (dominator, breakout age)
├─ OR: Situation-driven (handcuff RBs, backup QBs in SF)
└─ Avoid: "Safe" Day 3 players (low ceiling, no path to relevance)
```

**College Production Metrics:**

**Dominator Rating:**

```
Dominator = (Player_Rec_Yards + Player_Rec_TDs) / (Team_Total_Yards + Team_Total_TDs)

Thresholds:
- Elite (WR1 potential): 35%+
- Good (WR2 potential): 25-35%
- Average (WR3/Flex): 20-25%
- Concerning: < 20%

Example:
Marvin Harrison Jr. (2023):
- Receiving yards: 1,211 / OSU total receiving: 3,148 = 38.5%
- Receiving TDs: 14 / OSU total receiving TDs: 32 = 43.8%
- Dominator: 41.2% (ELITE - produced against elite competition)
```

**Breakout Age:**

```
Breakout Age = Age when player first achieves 20% dominator rating

Thresholds:
- Elite: Age 19 or younger (84th+ percentile)
- Good: Age 20-21 (50th-84th percentile)
- Concerning: Age 22+ (below 13th percentile)

Success rate: Players with age ≤19 breakout + 35%+ dominator = 65% WR2+ hit rate
```

**Concrete Rookie Example:**

```
Brian Thomas Jr. (2024 draft prospect):
- NFL Draft: 1st round, pick 23 (✓ Good capital)
- Breakout Age: 20 (2022 season) (✓ Good)
- Dominator: 41.3% (2023) (✓ Elite)
- YPRR: 3.21 (✓ Elite)
- Dynasty verdict: Top-5 rookie pick (all metrics align)

vs.

Keon Coleman (2024 draft prospect):
- NFL Draft: 2nd round, pick 33 (⚠ Okay capital)
- Breakout Age: 21 (2023 season) (⚠ Average)
- Dominator: 32.8% (2023) (✓ Good)
- YPRR: 2.89 (✓ Very good)
- Dynasty verdict: Picks 8-12 (solid, not elite profile)
```

## Section 4: Trade Value Methodologies

### 4.1 KeepTradeCut (KTC)

**Methodology:** Crowdsourced market consensus using adapted ELO algorithm.

**Data Sources:**

- 23+ million user rankings
- Users rank 3 players: Keep, Trade, Cut
- Real-time updates with every submission
- 25,000+ real dynasty trades tracked

**Algorithm:**

```
Base: ELO rating system (chess-inspired)

Process:
1. Initialize all players at 5,000 rating
2. User ranks Player A > Player B > Player C
3. Update ratings based on pairwise comparisons:
   - "Keep" player gains points
   - "Cut" player loses points
   - Magnitude depends on rating differential

4. Value Adjustment Algorithm (exponential):
   - Multi-player trades require adjustment
   - Example: 2 players worth 5,000 each ≠ 1 player worth 10,000
   - Consolidation premium: ~30-50% for star player
```

**Value Adjustment Formula:**

```
Adjusted_Value = Raw_Value × (1 + Consolidation_Premium)

Where Consolidation_Premium varies by tier:
- Elite (8,000+): +50% premium (harder to acquire, game-breakers)
- Good (6,000-8,000): +30% premium
- Average (4,000-6,000): +15% premium
- Replacement (<4,000): +0% premium (easily replaced)
```

**Concrete Example:**

```
TRADE EVALUATION:
Give: Justin Jefferson (9,500) + Chris Olave (6,200) = 15,700 raw
Get: Ja'Marr Chase (10,500)

Value adjustment:
- Jefferson premium: 9,500 × 1.50 = 14,250
- Olave premium: 6,200 × 1.30 = 8,060
- Chase premium: 10,500 × 1.50 = 15,750

Adjusted totals:
- Give: 14,250 + 8,060 = 22,310
- Get: 15,750
- Gap: -6,560 (-29% value loss)

KTC Verdict: DO NOT TRADE (consolidating but overpaying)
```

**Liquidity Scoring:**

```
Liquidity = Ease of trading player

Based on:
- Trade frequency (how often player changes hands)
- Time to trade (avg days from list to accept)
- Offer quantity (number of trade offers received)

Tiers:
- High liquidity: Elite players, hot rookies (trade in days)
- Medium liquidity: WR2/RB2 types (trade in weeks)
- Low liquidity: Aging vets, backups (trade in months, if ever)

Trading implication: Discount low-liquidity assets 10-20%
```

**Strengths:**

- Real-time market sentiment
- Massive data set (23M+ rankings)
- Format-specific values (1QB, Superflex, TEP)
- Free and accessible

**Limitations:**

- Recency bias (overreacts to big games)
- Hype inflation (rookie hype, "next Kelce" syndrome)
- No context (league-specific, roster fit, team state)
- Crowd wisdom ≠ optimal strategy

**Best Use Cases:**

- Market value baseline (what you CAN get, not what you should pay)
- Identifying arbitrage (compare to expert values)
- Trade calculator for multi-player deals
- Tracking value trends over time

### 4.2 DynastyProcess

**Methodology:** Algorithmic valuation with open-source customization.

**Philosophy:** "Data-driven, transparent, reproducible"

**Components:**

1. **Player Values**

   ```
   Based on exponential curve of expected points:

   Value = α × e^(β × Expected_Points)

   Where:
   - α (scale): Position-specific (RB vs WR vs QB)
   - β (shape): Determines curve steepness
   - Expected_Points: Weighted avg of recent production + projections
   ```

2. **Pick Valuation**

   ```
   Pick_Value = Weighted_Avg(Recent_Draft_Class_Values)

   Example (2024 picks using 2020-2023 classes):
   1.01 = Avg value of players drafted 1.01 in 2020-2023
       = (Breece Hall + Bijan Robinson + Travis Etienne + Jonathan Taylor) / 4
       = (7,200 + 8,500 + 6,800 + 7,500) / 4
       = 7,500
   ```

3. **Future Pick Discounting**

   ```
   Future_Pick_Value = Current_Pick_Value × Discount_Factor^Years_Out

   Discount_Factor = 0.80 (default, adjustable)

   Example:
   - 2025 1.01 = 7,500 (current)
   - 2026 1.01 = 7,500 × 0.80 = 6,000 (80% value)
   - 2027 1.01 = 7,500 × 0.64 = 4,800 (64% value)
   ```

4. **Draft Pick Value Chart (12-team league)**

| Pick | Value | Pick | Value | Pick | Value |
| ---- | ----- | ---- | ----- | ---- | ----- |
| 1.01 | 7,500 | 1.07 | 4,200 | 2.01 | 3,000 |
| 1.02 | 6,800 | 1.08 | 3,900 | 2.06 | 2,200 |
| 1.03 | 6,200 | 1.09 | 3,700 | 2.12 | 1,800 |
| 1.04 | 5,700 | 1.10 | 3,500 | 3.01 | 1,200 |
| 1.05 | 5,200 | 1.11 | 3,300 | 3.06 | 800   |
| 1.06 | 4,600 | 1.12 | 3,100 | 3.12 | 500   |

**Customization Parameters:**

Users can adjust:

- League size (8, 10, 12, 14, 16 team)
- Scoring (PPR, 0.5 PPR, Standard)
- Roster positions (Superflex, TE premium, etc.)
- Discount rate for future picks (0.70-0.90)
- Positional scarcity multipliers

**Trade Calculator Features:**

- Multi-player trades (no limit)
- Pick package analysis
- "Fair trade" range (±10% value)
- Alternative offers generator
- Export to CSV

**Concrete Example:**

```
REBUILDER PERSPECTIVE:

Give: Christian McCaffrey (age 27, value 8,200)
Get: 2025 1.03 (6,200) + 2026 1st (projected mid, 4,000) + Jahmyr Gibbs (age 22, 5,500)

Raw values:
- Give: 8,200
- Get: 6,200 + 4,000 + 5,500 = 15,700
- Gap: +7,500 (+91% value gain)

DynastyProcess verdict: ACCEPT (massive value win, aligns with rebuild timeline)
```

**Strengths:**

- Open-source (GitHub: github.com/dynastyprocess)
- Customizable for league context
- Transparent methodology
- Historical data tracking

**Limitations:**

- Backward-looking (based on past draft classes)
- Doesn't account for news/injuries in real-time
- Exponential curve may overvalue elites
- Requires understanding to customize properly

### 4.3 Market Timing Strategies

**Framework:** Player values fluctuate predictably based on NFL calendar, performance trends, and sentiment cycles.

### Sell-High Windows

**1. Touchdown Over-Performance**

```
TDOE (TD Over Expected) = Actual_TDs - Expected_TDs

Red flag: TDOE ≥ +3.0
- 86% of WRs with positive TDOE regress next season
- Average decline: -52% fewer TDs

Sell-high window: Offseason following TD spike year
- Peak value: Late season through NFL draft
- Dynasty managers see raw TD total, ignore context
```

**Example:**

```
Calvin Ridley (2020):
- TDs: 9 on 90 targets = 10% TD rate
- Expected TDs: 5.2 (based on team/target share)
- TDOE: +3.8 (extreme outlier)
- 2021 result: 3 TDs in 5 games before suspension
- Sell window: Offseason 2021 (peak value ~WR18)
- Actual value: Crashed to ~WR50 after regression
```

**2. Age-Based Cliffs**

```
Position: RB
Sell window: Before age 26.5 (before Year 5)
Rationale: 25.2% average decline ages 27-28

Position: WR
Sell window: Before age 30
Rationale: Gradual decline accelerates age 30+

Position: QB
Sell window: Before age 35 (rebuilders), 37+ (all)
Rationale: Mobile decline, injury risk increases
```

**3. Career-Year Performance**

```
Definition: Player produces career-high fantasy points

Sell window: Immediately following season through NFL draft
- Peak value: February-April (recent production fresh)
- Dynasty managers anchor on career year
- Market often ignores regression risk

Red flags (likely one-hit wonder):
- TD rate > 15% (unsustainable)
- YPRR increased but target share declined (efficiency + opportunity rarely both spike)
- Age 27+ RB (likely last elite season)
- New team/scheme change (unrepeatable situation)
```

### Buy-Low Windows

**1. Injury Discount**

```
Short-term injuries (4-8 weeks): 20-40% value drop
- ACL/Achilles: 40-60% drop (long-term concern)
- Broken bones: 20-30% drop (shorter recovery)
- Soft tissue (hamstring, calf): 10-20% drop (recurring concern)

Buy window: Week injury occurs through 2 weeks after return
- Maximum discount: During injury (perceived risk)
- Value recovery: Proves health with 2-3 good games

Example:
- Justin Jefferson (Week 5 2023 hamstring injury)
- Pre-injury value: 10,500 (WR1 overall)
- During injury: 7,800 (−26% drop)
- Post-return (healthy): 10,000+ (value restored)
- Buy window: Weeks 5-11 (while injured/returning)
```

**2. Negative TD Regression (Buy-High Opportunity)**

```
TDOE < -3.0 (underperformed TD expectation)
- 93% improve following season
- Often due to random variance, not skill decline

Buy window: Offseason following down year
- Market overreacts to low TD total
- Opportunity metrics (targets, target share) often still strong

Example:
- DJ Moore (2022):
- TDs: 0 (!) on 99 targets
- Expected TDs: 4.8
- TDOE: -4.8 (extreme negative outlier)
- Target share: 24.8% (excellent, sticky metric)
- Dynasty value: Crashed to ~WR30
- 2023 result: 8 TDs, 244.1 PPR pts (WR8 overall)
- Buy window: Offseason 2023 (massive discount)
```

**3. Offseason "Pretty Roster Syndrome"**

```
Pattern: Veterans undervalued April-July, recover value August-September

Causes:
- Rookie draft hype inflates young player values
- Veterans "boring" compared to shiny rookies
- Managers prioritize upside over proven production

Buy window: May-July (post-rookie draft, pre-season)
- Target: Proven WRs ages 27-29 (still in prime)
- Avoid: RBs ages 28+ (legitimate age concern)

Sell window: August-September (training camp hype builds)
- Same veterans gain 15-25% value as season approaches
- Contenders realize they need proven producers

Example:
- Stefon Diggs (May 2023):
- Value: 5,800 (post-rookie draft)
- August 2023: 7,200 (+24% gain)
- No performance change - just market psychology
```

**4. QB/Team Change Discount**

```
Pattern: Players changing teams often undervalued due to uncertainty

Reality: Most WRs maintain production across teams (sticky target share)

Buy window: Post-trade announcement through Week 3 of new team
- Maximum discount: Immediate post-trade (unknown fit)
- Value recovery: Proves role in new offense

Example:
- DeAndre Hopkins to Titans (2023):
- Pre-trade value: 4,200 (age 31 concern)
- Post-trade: 3,100 (−26% drop)
- Week 1-8 performance: WR17 (14.2 PPG)
- Value recovery: ~3,800 (proven fit)
- Buy window: May-June 2023
```

### Seasonal Value Cycles

```
CALENDAR              VALUE TRENDS                    TRADING STRATEGY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
January (Playoffs)    Contenders buy, Rebuilders sell  Sell to contenders
February (Off-season) Values stabilize                 Assessment period
March (Free Agency)   Situation changes create volatility Buy/sell on landing spots
April (NFL Draft)     Rookie hype peaks                Sell veterans, hold rookies
May (Rookie Drafts)   Veterans undervalued             BUY veterans
June-July (Dead period) Lowest veteran values         BUY WINDOW (veterans)
August (Preseason)    Values rise toward season        SELL WINDOW (veterans)
September (Week 1-4)  Hot starts overvalued           Sell hot starts
October (Week 5-9)    Injuries create opportunity     Buy injured
November (Weeks 10-13) Trade deadlines approach       Decisive buy/sell
December (Weeks 14-17) Playoff push                   Contenders all-in
```

## Section 5: Roster Construction

### 5.1 Positional Allocation Framework

**Optimal Roster Composition (25-30 roster spots):**

| Position | Starters | Bench/Taxi | Total | % of Roster |
| -------- | -------- | ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| **QB**   | 1-2      | 1-2        | 3     | 10-12%      |
| **RB**   | 2-3      | 4-5        | 7     | 23-28%      |
| **WR**   | 2-4      | 5-7        | 9     | 30-36%      |
| **TE**   | 1-2      | 3-4        | 5     | 16-20%      |
| **FLEX** | 1-3      | —          | —     | —           |

**Superflex Adjustments:**

```
QB: 3-4 (12-16% of roster) - must secure 2 starters + depth
RB: 6-7 (24-28%) - slightly reduced priority
WR: 8-10 (32-40%) - maintain foundation
TE: 4-5 (16-20%) - unchanged
```

**Rationale by Position:**

**Wide Receivers (Foundation):**

- Longest careers (7-10 years)
- Most stable value retention
- Lowest injury risk
- Gradual aging curves (maintain production to age 30+)
- **Rule:** "If in doubt, draft another WR"

**Running Backs (Depth Critical):**

- Shortest careers (2.57 years average)
- Highest injury risk (25-30% miss time annually)
- Sharp aging cliffs (age 27-28)
- Need 7+ to ensure 3 startable each week
- **Rule:** "You can never have too many startable RBs"

**Quarterbacks (Format-Dependent):**

- 1QB leagues: 2-3 QBs (stream-friendly, low priority)
- Superflex: 3-4 QBs (MUST secure, extreme scarcity)
- Longest careers (4.44 years average)
- **Rule (SF):** "Corner the QB market - 75% of NFL starters must be rostered"

**Tight Ends (Top-Heavy):**

- Elite tier (top-5) worth massive investment
- TE6-15 cluster tightly (minimal separation)
- Rookie TE rarely produce Year 1 (taxi squad candidates)
- Sophomore surge +98.5% Year 1 → Year 2
- **Rule:** "Either have an elite TE or stream - no middle ground"

______________________________________________________________________

### 5.2 Asset Accumulation Strategies

**Draft Pick Valuation:**

```
Pick Tier          │ Value Range │ Hit Rate │ Strategy
───────────────────┼─────────────┼──────────┼─────────────────────
Early 1sts (1-4)   │ 6,000-8,000 │ 60-70%   │ HOARD (core pieces)
Mid 1sts (5-8)     │ 4,000-6,000 │ 40-50%   │ ACCUMULATE (solid starters)
Late 1sts (9-12)   │ 3,000-4,000 │ 30-40%   │ PACKAGE (trade up or for vets)
Early 2nds (13-16) │ 2,000-3,000 │ 20-30%   │ HIGH-VARIANCE (upside swings)
Mid/Late 2nds+     │ 500-2,000   │ 10-20%   │ DART THROWS (lotteries)
```

**Future Pick Discounting:**

```
Year Out  │ Discount │ Reasoning
──────────┼──────────┼────────────────────────────────────────
Current   │ 100%     │ Known landing spots, clear value
+1 year   │ 85%      │ Draft class known, some uncertainty
+2 years  │ 70%      │ Unknown class, moderate uncertainty
+3 years  │ 55%      │ High uncertainty, devalued heavily
```

**Rebuild Pick Accumulation Target:**

```
GOAL: 4-6 first round picks over next 2 years

Example rebuild haul:
- 2025: 1.01 (own), 1.05 (traded vet), 1.09 (traded vet)
- 2026: 1st (own, projected early), 1st (traded vet), 1st (traded vet)
- Total: 6 first round picks → 3-4 hits expected → Core built

Method:
- Sell ALL aging vets (RB 26+, WR 29+)
- Target: 1st + young player for each vet
- Accept lower value for better picks (1st > 2nd+3rd)
```

**Trading Techniques:**

**1. Trade Back and Tier Down**

```
Give: 1.02 (elite prospect, value 6,800)
Get: 1.07 (good prospect, value 4,200) + 2026 2nd (value 1,700) + Young WR (value 2,000)

Analysis:
- Give: 6,800
- Get: 7,900
- Gain: +1,100 (+16%)
- Rationale: Drop one tier, gain quantity (rebuilders prefer quantity)
```

**2. Combine Assets for Stars**

```
Give: 1.05 (value 5,200) + 1.11 (value 3,300) + 2026 2nd (value 1,700)
Get: Ja'Marr Chase (value 10,500)

Analysis:
- Give: 10,200
- Get: 10,500
- Even value, but contenders prefer quality
- Rationale: Consolidate picks into proven elite player
```

**3. Young Player Speculation**

**Target Profile:**

- Age 24 or younger
- Year 2-3 (sophomore/breakout window)
- Good opportunity metrics (target share 18%+, snap % 60%+)
- Undervalued due to low TD total (TDOE negative)

**Buy windows:**

- Post-rookie year (before breakout)
- During TD slumps (negative TDOE)
- Team/QB change uncertainty

**Example targets (2024 offseason):**

```
Jordan Addison (WR, MIN):
- Age: 22 (entering Year 2)
- Year 1: 70-911-10 (solid rookie year)
- TDOE: +2.8 (TD regression risk, but young)
- Value: ~4,500 (WR30 range)
- Upside: WR1 target share if Thielen replacement
- Risk: Jefferson dominates, limits ceiling
- Verdict: BUY (upside > downside, youth premium)

Jahmyr Gibbs (RB, DET):
- Age: 21 (entering Year 2)
- Year 1: 945 total yards, 10 TDs (elite efficiency)
- Opportunity: 50% RB snap share (split with Montgomery)
- Value: ~5,500 (RB15 range)
- Upside: Montgomery declines/leaves, Gibbs 60%+ share
- Risk: RB age curve means only 3-4 elite years remaining
- Verdict: BUY (contenders), HOLD (rebuilders, will age out)
```

**4. Veteran Value Extraction**

**Sell Timing:**

- RBs: Sell one year BEFORE expected decline (age 26, before Year 5)
- WRs: Sell two years before expected decline (age 29-30)
- QBs (SF): Hold through age 34, sell before 36

**Sell Strategy:**

- Never hold through cliff (value craters)
- Accept 80% of peak value to sell early
- Target contenders (will pay premium)

**Example:**

```
Davante Adams (age 31 WR):
- 2023 production: WR5 (272.9 PPR)
- Current value: ~5,000 (age discount)
- Expected decline: Age 32-33 (1-2 years)
- Sell target: 2025 1st (mid, value 4,000) + Young WR (value 2,500) = 6,500 total
- Rationale: Extract 130% current value before age cliff

### 5.3 Competitive Window Management

**The 2-3 Year Window Framework:**

```
PHILOSOPHY: Balance WINNING NOW with SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVENESS

Goal: Not just one championship, but 2-3 years of championship equity

Core Principle: "The goal is multiple championships, not burning out after one."
```

**Window Identification:**

| Factor           | Contending (2-3yr window) | Aging Out (1yr max) | Pre-Window (\<2yrs)     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Core age**     | 24-28                     | 28-31               | 22-24                   |
| **RB situation** | 3+ RBs age 24-27          | 2+ RBs age 28+      | 0-1 proven RB           |
| **WR situation** | 3+ WR2+ in prime          | 2+ WRs age 30+      | 2+ young WRs developing |
| **Pick capital** | 1-2 future 1sts           | 0-1 future 1sts     | 4+ future 1sts          |
| **Timeline**     | Compete 2025-2027         | Compete 2025 only   | Compete 2027+           |

**Strategy by Window:**

**2-3 Year Window (IDEAL):**

```
DO:
├─ Trade future 1sts (2026+) for current players
├─ Target players ages 24-28 (align with window)
├─ Load RBs (2-3 year shelf life fits window)
├─ Balance youth + vets (some pieces for future window)
└─ Make "soft landings" trades (build next window)

DON'T:
├─ Trade 2025 1st/2nd (may need for reload)
├─ Acquire aging vets (RBs 29+, WRs 32+) unless elite
├─ Overpay for one-year rentals (window is multi-year)
└─ Fully liquidate (need assets for soft landing)
```

**1 Year Window (RISKY):**

```
DO:
├─ Go ALL-IN if championship equity > 25%
├─ Trade ALL future picks (2025-2027)
├─ Accept aging players (RBs 28-30) if productive NOW
├─ Maximize short-term (accept negative long-term value)
└─ Plan rebuild DURING season (sell at deadline if not competing)

DON'T:
├─ Half-commit (either all-in or start rebuild)
├─ Acquire young players (won't help this year)
├─ Hold future picks (no value in 1-year window)
└─ Ignore decline (RBs 30+ will crater next year)
```

**Pre-Window (PATIENT):**

```
DO:
├─ HOLD all young players (in 2 years = peak)
├─ Accumulate picks (draft core, not buy core)
├─ Target ages 22-24 (will be 24-26 in 2 years)
├─ Avoid RBs (will be 26-28 in 2 years = declining)
└─ Be PATIENT (resist urge to compete early)

DON'T:
├─ Trade picks for vets (vets will age out before window)
├─ Acquire RBs age 24+ (will be 26+ when window opens)
├─ Compete Year 2 (ruins foundation, extends timeline)
└─ Panic sell young players (they're your core!)
```

**Soft Landing vs. Hard Rebuild:**

**Soft Landing (PREFERRED for 2-3yr windows):**

```
TIMELINE: Competitive → Retool (1 year) → Competitive

Example:
- Year 1-3: Contending (made playoffs, won 1 championship)
- Year 4: Core aging (RBs 28+, WRs 30+)
- SELL before cliff: Trade aging vets for young players + picks
- BUY young players: Target ages 23-25 (cheap, entering prime)
- Year 5: Competitive again (young core now in peak)

Key: Avoid bottom-4 finish (no tanking needed)
- Soft landing maintains competitiveness
- Quicker rebuild (1-2 years vs. 3-4)
```

**Hard Rebuild (REQUIRED for 1yr windows):**

```
TIMELINE: Competitive → Full Teardown (2 years) → Competitive

Example:
- Year 1: All-in (championship or bust)
- Year 2: Aging core (RBs 30+, value cratered)
- NO assets to retool (traded all picks)
- FORCED full rebuild: Sell everyone, tank 2 years
- Year 5: Competitive again (long rebuild)

Key: Must finish bottom-4 (need elite picks)
- Hard rebuild requires 3-4 years
- High risk (all-in Year 1 or bust)
```

**Recommendation:** Target 2-3 year windows (sustainable), avoid 1-year windows (risky).

______________________________________________________________________

## Section 6: Contract & Cap Management

### 6.1 Contract Valuation Frameworks

**Cost Per Point (CPP):**

```
CPP = Annual_Cap_Hit / Expected_Annual_Fantasy_Points

Lower CPP = Better value

Thresholds (PPR scoring):
- Elite value: CPP < $0.10
- Good value: CPP $0.10-0.15
- Fair value: CPP $0.15-0.20
- Overpaid: CPP > $0.20
```

**Example:**

```
Christian McCaffrey:
- Cap hit: $25 per year
- Expected points: 280 PPG
- CPP: $25 / 280 = $0.089
- Verdict: ELITE VALUE (worth the salary)

Najee Harris:
- Cap hit: $18 per year
- Expected points: 190 PPG
- CPP: $18 / 190 = $0.095
- Verdict: ELITE VALUE (cheaper option)
```

**Contract Efficiency:**

```
Contract_Efficiency = Total_Expected_Fantasy_Points / Total_Cap_Hit

Higher efficiency = Better value (inverse of CPP)

Use for multi-year contracts:
- Accounts for aging/decline
- Incorporates time value
- Compares contracts of different lengths
```

**Example:**

```
Player A: $20/yr for 3 years
- Year 1: 250 pts
- Year 2: 240 pts
- Year 3: 220 pts
- Total: 710 pts / $60 = 11.83 efficiency

Player B: $10/yr for 1 year
- Year 1: 180 pts
- Total: 180 pts / $10 = 18.00 efficiency

Verdict: Player B more efficient per dollar, but Player A provides more total value
```

______________________________________________________________________

### 6.2 Value Over Replacement Contract (VORC)

**Formula:**

```
VORC = (Player_Points - Replacement_Points) / Contract_Cost

Replacement Points:
- RB: RB24 baseline (~125 pts in PPR)
- WR: WR36 baseline (~140 pts in PPR)
- QB: QB12 baseline (~280 pts)
- TE: TE12 baseline (~110 pts)
```

**Example:**

```
Jonathan Taylor:
- Expected points: 250
- Cap hit: $30
- Replacement RB (RB24): 125 pts
- VORC: (250 - 125) / $30 = 4.17 points per dollar above replacement

vs.

Travis Etienne:
- Expected points: 200
- Cap hit: $18
- Replacement RB: 125 pts
- VORC: (200 - 125) / $18 = 4.17 points per dollar above replacement

Verdict: IDENTICAL value despite Taylor's higher raw points
```

**Strategic Implication:** Mid-tier players on cheap contracts often provide better VORC than superstars.

______________________________________________________________________

### 6.3 Present Value Calculations

**Formula (adapted from NFL contracts):**

```
PV = FV / (1 + r)^n

Where:
- PV = Present value
- FV = Future value (cap hit in future year)
- r = Inflation rate (typically 5% for dynasty)
- n = Years in future
```

**Example:**

```
3-year contract: $20/yr ($60 total)

Year 1: $20 / (1.05)^0 = $20.00
Year 2: $20 / (1.05)^1 = $19.05
Year 3: $20 / (1.05)^2 = $18.14

Total PV: $57.19 (vs. $60 nominal)

Implication: Back-loaded contracts have lower present value (prefer cap hits later)
```

______________________________________________________________________

### 6.4 Salary Cap Strategy

**Position Allocation Benchmarks (1QB PPR, $200 cap):**

| Position       | % of Cap | $ Amount | Rationale                        |
| -------------- | -------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| **RB**         | 45-55%   | $90-110  | Highest scarcity, win-now        |
| **WR**         | 25-30%   | $50-60   | Volume needed, moderate scarcity |
| **QB**         | 10-15%   | $20-30   | Low scarcity, streamable         |
| **TE**         | 5-10%    | $10-20   | Top-heavy, pay for elite or punt |
| **Bench/Flex** | 10%      | $20      | Injury depth, bye weeks          |

**Superflex Adjustments:**

```
QB: 30-40% ($60-80) - extreme scarcity, must secure 2
RB: 30-35% ($60-70) - reduced priority
WR: 20-25% ($40-50) - maintain volume
TE: 5-10% ($10-20) - unchanged
```

**The 70/30 Rule:**

```
70% of cap → Starters (best 9-10 players)
30% of cap → Depth (bench, bye weeks, injuries)

Violating this rule:
- >75% to starters: Fragile (one injury = no replacement)
- >35% to bench: Weak starting lineup (lose to better starters)
```

**Elite Player Cap % Benchmarks:**

| Tier           | Cap %  | $ (of $200) | Example Players         |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| **RB1-5**      | 20-25% | $40-50      | CMC, Bijan, Breece      |
| **RB6-12**     | 15-20% | $30-40      | Gibbs, Etienne, Mixon   |
| **WR1-5**      | 15-20% | $30-40      | Jefferson, Chase, Lamb  |
| **WR6-15**     | 10-15% | $20-30      | Olave, DK, Waddle       |
| **QB1-5 (SF)** | 20-25% | $40-50      | Mahomes, Allen, Burrow  |
| **TE1-3**      | 10-15% | $20-30      | Kelce, Andrews, LaPorta |

______________________________________________________________________

### 6.5 Dead Cap Management

**Dead Cap Formula:**

```
Dead_Cap = Remaining_Guaranteed_Money / Years_Left_On_Contract

When cutting player:
Net_Cap_Savings = Current_Year_Cap_Hit - Dead_Cap_Hit
```

**Break-Even Framework:**

```
CUT PLAYER IF:
(Net_Cap_Savings - Replacement_Cost) > 0

Where:
- Net_Cap_Savings = Salary saved - Dead cap
- Replacement_Cost = $ to acquire comparable player
```

**Example:**

```
Aging RB:
- Current cap hit: $35
- Dead cap if cut: $15
- Net savings: $20

Replacement RB:
- Cost to acquire: $12 (younger, cheaper)
- Net benefit: $20 - $12 = $8 saved

Decision: CUT (save $8 in cap, get younger player)
```

**Sunk Cost Principle:**

```
❌ WRONG: "I can't cut him, I'd take $15 dead cap!"
✓ CORRECT: "Dead cap is sunk cost. Is he worth $35 going forward?"

Dead cap amount should NEVER deter optimal decision.
- Dead cap spent whether you cut or keep
- Only question: Is his production worth his remaining cap hit?
```

**June 1st Designation:**

```
Benefit: Spread dead cap over 2 years

Example:
- Total dead cap: $20
- Cut before June 1: $20 dead cap in Year 1
- Cut after June 1: $10 dead cap in Year 1, $10 in Year 2

When to use:
- Need cap relief THIS YEAR (spread pain to next year)
- Not rebuilding (have time to absorb over 2 years)

When NOT to use:
- Rebuilding (take all dead cap now, clean slate for window)
- Need cap space next year more than this year
```

### 6.6 Extension Decision Framework

**Extend vs. Let Walk Decision Tree:**

```
Should I extend this player?

├─ Is player under age 27 (RB) / 30 (WR) / 34 (QB)?
│  ├─ NO → Let walk (age cliff imminent)
│  └─ YES → Continue
│
├─ Has player produced top-15 at position in 2 of last 3 years?
│  ├─ NO → Let walk (not proven)
│  └─ YES → Continue
│
├─ Is extension cost ≤ 90% of market value?
│  ├─ NO → Let walk (overpay)
│  └─ YES → Continue
│
├─ Does timeline align with team window?
│  ├─ NO → Trade (mismatched timeline)
│  └─ YES → EXTEND
```

**Extension Valuation Formula:**

```
Extension_Value = (Market_Value × 0.90) + $5_Control_Premium

Market_Value = Avg salary of top-10 players at position

Example:
Market value for WR2 (ranks 11-20): $22
Extension value: ($22 × 0.90) + $5 = $24.80

Rationale:
- 10% discount for avoiding free agency bidding war
- $5 premium for years of control (certainty)
```

**Rookie Contract Extension Strategy:**

```
Year 1: NEVER extend (too early, unproven)
Year 2: RARELY extend (exception: transcendent rookies)
Year 3: OPTIMAL EXTENSION WINDOW (proven but not yet free agent)
Year 4: LAST CHANCE (or lose to free agency)
```

**Example:**

```
Ja'Marr Chase rookie contract:
- Year 1 (2021): WR6 (elite rookie year)
- Year 2 (2022): WR1 (proven elite)
- Year 3 (2023): WR2 (sustained excellence)

Extension window: Summer 2024 (entering Year 4)
- Market value: $40 (top-3 WR salary)
- Extension value: ($40 × 0.90) + $5 = $41
- Decision: EXTEND at $41/yr for 4 years
- Rationale: Locks in prime years (ages 24-27), fair market price
```

**Veteran Extension Timing:**

| Position | Extend Before Age | Max Extension Length | Rationale               |
| -------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **RB**   | 27                | 2 years              | Age 27-28 cliff         |
| **WR**   | 30                | 3-4 years            | Gradual age 30+ decline |
| **QB**   | 34                | 3-4 years            | Maintain to late 30s    |
| **TE**   | 30                | 2-3 years            | Steep age 31+ decline   |

______________________________________________________________________

### 6.7 Contract Efficiency Scoring

**Composite Metric:**

```
Contract_Efficiency_Score = (VORC × 0.4) + (CPP_Rank × 0.3) + (Age_Score × 0.3)

Components:
1. VORC (40% weight): Value over replacement per dollar
2. CPP Rank (30% weight): Percentile ranking of cost per point
3. Age Score (30% weight): Remaining prime years (position-specific)

Score interpretation:
- 90-100: Elite contract (outperform value)
- 70-90: Good contract (fair value)
- 50-70: Overpaid (negative value)
- <50: Terrible contract (cut candidate)
```

**Example:**

```
Amon-Ra St. Brown (Age 24 WR, $15/yr):
- Expected points: 250
- VORC: (250 - 140) / $15 = 7.33 (elite)
- CPP: $15 / 250 = $0.06 (top 10% of WRs)
- Age Score: 95 (age 24, 6+ prime years left)

Contract_Efficiency = (7.33 × 0.4) + (90 × 0.3) + (95 × 0.3) = 88.5

Verdict: GOOD CONTRACT (outperforming value, locked in through prime)
```
