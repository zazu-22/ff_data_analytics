# Reception Perception Dynasty Rankings

In addition to my dynasty rankings, you’ll find notes, tiers, and buy/sell/hold designations for the wide receivers listed. I want to be able to offer readers as much context as possible when ranking these players. These designations are not pieces of trade advice or anything “market” related – do no believe in spoon-feeding fantasy content – they are more about whether I am buying their current production relative to expectations and how they’re charting in Reception Perception.

Below is a key to the tiers sorting:

- Tier 1: Prized dynasty asset
- Tier 2: Knocking on the door of Tier 1
- Tier 3: Pristine youth or high-end WR1 starter
- Tier 4: Youth or upside to be Top-15 in season
- Tier 5: Strong to solid building block
- Tier 6: Mix of player ages (lack of youth) with one or two future questions
- Tier 7: Random bench players
- Tier 8: At least these guys are on on the field
- Tier 9: Barely hanging on

Due to time constraints, I had to do away with the change log, but the notes section of the ranks will be more up-to-date going forward to reflect the player’s current status.

These are available exclusively to Reception Perception SICKO/VIP and PRIME subscribers. For security reasons, you can only view them on the website now, not on the original Google Sheet. If you have questions, join the Discord and we’ll discuss as a community.

***If you want to use these JUST for rookie rankings,  type the current year into the search bar on the top left and it will filter for the most recent class. They will only be added after they are drafted. If you want to see how I ranked the rookies as prospects, that is available via the multi-year stacked board.***
