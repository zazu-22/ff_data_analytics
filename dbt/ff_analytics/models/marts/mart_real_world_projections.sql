/*
Real-world projections mart - weekly/season player projections (no fantasy scoring).

Grain: One row per player per season per week per horizon per asof_date
Source: fact_player_projections (pivoted from long to wide form)

Part of 2Ã—2 model:
- Real-world base: This mart (physical stats)
- Fantasy scoring: mart_fantasy_projections (applies dim_scoring_rule)

Usage: Analysis of raw projections, input to variance analysis
