      Staged Commissioner CONTRACTS_CUT sheet - dead cap obligations from past cuts.

      **Grain**: One row per franchise per player per obligation year per snapshot date
      **Source**: Commissioner Google Sheet franchise tabs (dead cap CSV section) → parse_contracts()
      **Key Transformations**:
      - GM name → franchise_id (SCD Type 2 temporal join)
      - Player name → player_id via dim_player_id_xref + dim_name_alias
      - Player_key composite identifier for grain uniqueness

      **Purpose**:
      This table represents the **source of truth** for dead cap obligations calculated
      per league rules (50% years 1-2, 25% years 3-5). It serves as the validation
      baseline for comparing against transaction-derived dead cap calculations.

      **Relationship to Other Tables**:
      - stg_sheets__contracts_active: Active roster obligations
      - stg_sheets__contracts_cut: Dead cap from past cuts
      - Combined = Total salary cap obligations

      **Player Mapping**:
      Uses same resolution cascade as contracts_active:
      1. Transaction history (authoritative, position-aware)
      2. Crosswalk with position filtering
      3. Unmapped players preserved with player_id = -1

          - Mapped players: positive integer mfl_id
          - Unmapped players: -1 or NULL (crosswalk miss)
          Unmapped players are preserved via player_key composite identifier.
