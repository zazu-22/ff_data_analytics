/*
Fact table for fantasy football projections (real-world stats only).

Grain: One row per player per stat per horizon per as-of date
Sources: stg_ffanalytics__projections (weighted consensus)

Part of 2Ã—2 model:
- Real-world projections: This fact (measure_domain='real_world')
- Fantasy projections: mart_fantasy_projections (applies dim_scoring_rule)

Key differences from fact_player_stats:
- No game_id (projections are weekly/season-long, not per-game)
- Includes horizon column ('weekly', 'full_season', 'rest_of_season')
- Includes asof_date (when projection was made)
- Week can be NULL for full_season projections

ADR-007: Separate fact table from actuals to avoid nullable game_id in primary key
