# Multi-Source Snapshot Governance (Implementation Workspace)

**Version**: 2.0\
**Date**: 2025-11-07\
**Status**: Active

______________________________________________________________________

This directory is the working hub for planning and tracking implementation of unified snapshot governance across all data providers.

## Goals

- Establish consistent snapshot metadata and selection across all 5 sources (nflverse, sheets, ktc, ffanalytics, sleeper)
- Stabilize dbt staging with parameterized snapshot selection (baseline + latest strategies)
- Provide validation and monitoring of coverage/deltas before dbt execution
- Prepare for cloud-ready storage and comprehensive Prefect orchestration
- Implement CI-integrated validation from the start

## Implementation Approach

This implementation includes **Phase 0** for scope ratification, registry approval, and success metrics definition before beginning technical work. This ensures alignment on:

- Prefect orchestration for all 5 sources (Phases 1+2 scope)
- Snapshot registry seed as governance foundation
- Tightened freshness thresholds per source
- CI-integrated validation tooling

## Key Decisions

### Team Decisions (Confirmed)

1. **Prefect Orchestration Scope**: All 5 sources (nflverse, sheets, ktc, ffanalytics, sleeper) — Phases 1+2 implementation
2. **Freshness Coverage**: All 5 sources with tightened thresholds (sheets/sleeper: 1 day, nflverse/ffanalytics: 2 days, ktc: 5 days)
3. **Snapshot Registry**: Implement registry seed for governance
4. **Validation Tooling**: Extend existing `tools/analyze_snapshot_coverage.py` + create `tools/validate_manifests.py` with CI integration
5. **Phase 0 Inclusion**: Formalize kickoff decisions before implementation

### Technical Selections

- **Snapshot Selection Macro**: `snapshot_selection_strategy(source_glob, strategy, baseline_dt)` with three strategies (latest_only, baseline_plus_latest, all)
- **Sample Path Structure**: `data/raw/<source>/_samples/<dataset>/dt=YYYY-MM-DD/`
- **Freshness Tests**: `loaded_at_field: dt` with per-source warn/error thresholds
- **Documentation Priority**: Update SPEC checklist first, then create ops docs

## Phase Overview

| Phase       | Focus                  | Key Deliverables                                                   |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Phase 0** | Kickoff & Ratification | Scope confirmation, registry approval, success metrics             |
| **Phase 1** | Foundation             | Macro implementation, staging updates, samples relocation          |
| **Phase 2** | Governance             | Registry seed, validation tooling, freshness tests (all 5 sources) |
| **Phase 3** | Documentation          | SPEC checklist update, 6 ops docs creation                         |
| **Phase 4** | Orchestration          | 5 Prefect flows (local execution), governance integration          |
| **Phase 5** | CI Planning            | Parallel run strategy, rollback procedures                         |
| **Phase 6** | Cloud Blueprint        | GCS migration documentation (no implementation)                    |

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Zero hardcoded snapshot dates in staging models
- [ ] Snapshot registry tracking current/historical snapshots for all sources
- [ ] Working Prefect flows for all 5 sources (local execution)
- [ ] Freshness tests providing pre-dbt safety net (all 5 sources including Sleeper)
- [ ] CI transition plan documented with rollback procedures
- [ ] Cloud migration blueprint complete

## Out of Scope

- Prefect Phases 3-4 (backfill orchestration, advanced monitoring, cloud deployment)
- Actual cloud migration execution (blueprint only in Phase 6)
- CI cut-over execution (planning only in Phase 5)
- Full GitHub Actions replacement
- Advanced monitoring dashboards
