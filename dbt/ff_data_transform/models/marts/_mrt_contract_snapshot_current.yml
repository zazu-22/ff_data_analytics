      Contract snapshot mart - current contract obligations by year (transaction-derived).

      **Grain**: One row per player per franchise per contract period per obligation year
      **Source**: dim_player_contract_history (expands contract_split_array into year-by-year rows)

      Shows each player's current active contract broken down by year, including:
      - Annual cap hit for each obligation year
      - Remaining contract value from each year forward
      - Dead cap liability if cut before that year
      - Contract metadata (type, rookie flag, effective dates)

      **Extension Handling**: contract_split_array already contains full remaining schedule
      per league accounting conventions (e.g., 6-6-24 = 2 base years + 1 extension year).

      **Use Cases**:
      - Salary cap planning: Future year obligations
      - Dead cap analysis: Cut liability scenarios
      - Contract timeline: Expiration tracking
      - Rookie contract management: Extension decisions
