/*
Player dimension - conformed dimension for all player-based analysis.

Grain: One row per player (player_id as canonical identifier)
Source: dim_player_id_xref seed (nflverse ff_playerids with 19 provider ID mappings)

SCD Type 1 (overwrite): team (current team assignment)
SCD Type 0 (immutable): draft_year, birthdate

Attributes include display name, position, team, and all provider ID mappings
for cross-platform integration.

Key Design Decision: player_id (sequential surrogate key) is the canonical identifier
used throughout the pipeline. mfl_id remains available as an attribute for provider
integration but is NOT the primary key.
