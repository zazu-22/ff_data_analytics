# Task 2.5: League Roster Depth Analysis

**Sprint:** Sprint 1 (Post-FASA Enhancement)
**Phase:** Phase 2 Extension
**Estimated Duration:** 4 hours
**Priority:** MEDIUM (improves value assessment)

______________________________________________________________________

## Objective

Build `mart_league_roster_depth` to enable true **Value Over Replacement (VoR)** calculations by comparing FA targets to **all rostered players** across the league, not just other free agents.

______________________________________________________________________

## Context

**Problem:** Current `mart_fasa_targets` calculates replacement level as 25th percentile of FA pool only. This doesn't show how FA targets compare to starting lineups league-wide.

**Example:**
```
Current (FA-only baseline):
- Zonovan Knight: 11.1 PPG, value_score = 74
- Replacement (25th %ile FA RB): 2.5 PPG
- Points above replacement: +8.6 PPG

Enhanced (league-wide baseline):
- Zonovan Knight: 11.1 PPG
- League median RB2: 8.7 PPG  ← True benchmark
- Value over typical RB2: +2.4 PPG
- Would be RB8 if rostered (top 20%)
```

This shows Knight is an **upgrade** but not elite, providing better context for bidding decisions.

## Dependencies

- ✅ `stg_sheets__contracts_active` exists (my roster + all other teams)
- ✅ `mart_fantasy_projections` exists (ROS projections for all players)
- ✅ `dim_league_rules` exists (roster slot requirements)

## Files to Create

### 1. `dbt/ff_analytics/models/marts/mart_league_roster_depth.sql`

**Purpose:** Rank all rostered players by position with league percentiles

**Grain:** `franchise_id, player_key, asof_date`

**SQL Spec:**

```sql
{{
  config(
    materialized='table'
  )

## Implementation Steps

1. Create `mart_league_roster_depth.sql`
2. Create corresponding `_mart_league_roster_depth.yml` tests
3. Run: `make dbt-run MODELS=mart_league_roster_depth`
4. Run: `make dbt-test MODELS=mart_league_roster_depth`
5. Validate Jason's roster appears correctly ranked

SELECT DISTINCT position,
       median_starter_ppg,

## Commit Message

```
feat: add league roster depth mart for true VoR analysis

Rank all 300+ rostered players by position with league-wide benchmarks:
- Team depth charts (RB1, RB2, FLEX, Bench)
- League percentiles (Elite/Strong/Viable/Weak tiers)
- Points above replacement vs league median starters

Enables comparison of FA targets to actual starting lineups,
not just other free agents.

Part of Sprint 1 Phase 2 enhancements.
```

## Next Steps

After this task completes:
- **Task 2.6**: Enhance `mart_fasa_targets` to include league VoR context
