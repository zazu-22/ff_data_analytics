/*
Real-world actuals mart - weekly player performance in physical stats (no fantasy scoring).

Grain: One row per player per season per week
Source: fact_player_stats (pivoted from long to wide form)

Part of 2Ã—2 model:
- This mart: Real-world actuals (yards, TDs, receptions, etc.)
- Partner mart: mart_fantasy_actuals_weekly (applies scoring rules)

Provides denormalized player/team attributes via dimension joins for ease of querying.
