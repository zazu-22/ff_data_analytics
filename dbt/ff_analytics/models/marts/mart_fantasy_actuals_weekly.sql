Fantasy actuals mart - weekly player performance with fantasy scoring applied.

Grain: One row per player per season per week
Source: mart_real_world_actuals_weekly (with scoring rules applied from dim_scoring_rule)

Part of 2Ã—2 model:
- Real-world base: mart_real_world_actuals_weekly (physical stats)
- Fantasy scoring: This mart (applies dim_scoring_rule dynamically)

League scoring: Half-PPR + IDP (data-driven from seed)
- Passing: From dim_scoring_rule.pass_* rules
- Rushing: From dim_scoring_rule.rush_* rules
- Receiving: From dim_scoring_rule.rec_* rules
- IDP: From dim_scoring_rule.idp_* rules
